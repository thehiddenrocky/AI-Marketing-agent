Are there any AI-type options out there that can help organize the requests, automate responses, and more importantly identify common requests that we can streamline addressing (i.e. send me usage for X account with XYZ parameters)?

            "selftext": "I've been building LLM-based applications in my day job and the whole proecess feels **so inefficient.** On the one hand, current frameworks introduce so much complexity that most people end up prefering to write code from scratch. On the other, I'm always amazed by how people build agents as **monoliths** today. For instance, if you are building a stock trading agent, you also build the web scraper agent for gathering financial info, the processing models etc.\n\n**This makes no sense.** In the example above, the web scraper agent for financial data is useful for hundreds of different applications. But people usually reinvent the wheel, there's no easy way to embed other people's agent on your workflows, for a number of reasons.   \nI always thought that the most efficient way to build agentic systems would:\n\n1. Have an **open-source community that collaborates to build specialized agents** that are reusable for many use cases.\n\n2. Have a  framework that makes it **easy to embed** different agents into a single multi-agent system that accomplishes particular tasks.\n\n3. A platform (like Docker Hub or HuggingFace) where people can **push and pull their projects from.**\n\n  \n[So I created GenSphere.](https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere) Its an open-source declarative framework to build LLM-based applications. I'm trying to solve the problems above, and also trying to build a community to develop these reusable agents.   \nDoes this resonate with you? What are your thoughts? \n\nIf you want to know more, check the \n\nmedium articule: [https://medium.com/@gensphere/community-driven-development-of-llm-applications-introducing-gensphere-182fd2a70e3e](https://medium.com/@gensphere/community-driven-development-of-llm-applications-introducing-gensphere-182fd2a70e3e)\n\ndocs: [https://gensphere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://gensphere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n repo: [https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere](https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere)",

And today I'm happy to share an incredible amount of progress, and excited to get people to try it out.\n\nTo that effect, I've created a few videos that show you how to install the platform and an overview of it:\n\n* [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojhcb9ADJqU) (11:38)\n* [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXGk6g_gPtU) (8:38)\n\nRepository: [Link](https://github.com/MarianoMolina/project_alice)\n\n# What is it though?\n\nA free open source framework and platform for agentic workflows. It includes a frontend, backend and a python logic module. It takes 5 minutes to install, no coding needed, and you get a frontend where you can create your own agents, chats, task/workflows, etc, run your tasks and/or chat with your agents. You can use local models, or most of the most used API providers for AI generation.\n\nYou don't need to know how to code at all, but if you do, you have full flexibility to improve any aspect of it since its all open source. The platform has been purposefully created so that it's code is comprehensible, easy to upgrade and improve. Frontend and backend are in TS, python module uses Pydantic almost to a pedantic level.\n\nIt has a total of 22 apis at the moment:\n\n        OPENAI\n        OPENAI_VISION\n        OPENAI_IMG_GENERATION\n        OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS\n        OPENAI_TTS\n        OPENAI_STT\n        OPENAI_ASTT\n        AZURE\n        GEMINI\n        GEMINI_VISION\n        GEMINI_IMG_GEN => Google's sdk is broken atm\n        MISTRAL\n        MISTRAL_VISION\n        MISTRAL_EMBEDDINGS\n        GEMINI_STT\n        GEMINI_EMBEDDINGS\n        COHERE\n        GROQ\n        GROQ_VISION\n        GROQ_TTS\n        META\n        META_VISION\n        ANTHROPIC\n        ANTHROPIC_VISION\n        LM_STUDIO\n        LM_STUDIO_VISION\n        GOOGLE_SEARCH\n        REDDIT_SEARCH\n        WIKIPEDIA_SEARCH\n        EXA_SEARCH\n        ARXIV_SEARCH\n        GOOGLE_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\n\nAnd an uncountable number of models that you can deploy with it.\n\nIt is going to keep getting better. If you think this is nice, wait until the next update drops. And if you feel like helping out, I'd be super grateful. I'm about to tackle RAG and ReACT capabilities in my agents, and I'm sure a lot of people here have some experience with that. Maybe the idea of trying to come up with a (maybe industry?) standard sounds interesting?\n\nCheck out the videos if you want some help installing and understanding the frontend. Ask me any questions otherwise!",

It takes any webpage, processes the content, and spits out the 3-5 most important points so you can digest info faster! No more endless scrolling through fluff just to get the main idea. 🧠⚡\n\nBuilt this because I was tired of losing time trying to sift through long articles for research, and I figured others might feel the same! Check it out if you're into productivity hacks. Would love feedback from this awesome community! 💬\nhttps://github.com/rohithvijayan/PageSnack\n",

You have to deal with stochastic gradient descent oscillation failure rates, which often lead to vanishing data-loss differentials in high-dimensional spaces. Moreover, the convolutional topology of the neural matrix requires real-time tensor interpolation at every decision junction, otherwise, you risk triggering recursive overfitting loops, exacerbated by non-linear backpropagation delays.\n\n     Don’t even get me started on the integration phase—dynamic vector embeddings must be transposed through parallel inference pipelines, while handling decoupled GPU-accelerated quantum-computing matrix vectors to ensure coherent output across multi-modal streams. Production-ready agents also suffer from algorithmic cascade failure when the training set enters an asymptotic deviation beyond the fifth-dimensional manifold!\n\n     Even after all of that, you still have to optimize for latency across distributed nodes, which requires synchronous cluster coherency and n-ary data-sharding algorithms to minimize the I/O entropy rate in microservice architectures.",

Why can't I just say: full out this form from the data in  database.docx ? \n* Periodically we download some cvs files from 3 different systems, and then, in excel, we merge/clean/enrich the data to create 1 single large table.

Should I use DSPy to build it? Which retriever technique works best? Should I switch to a different generator model? And most importantly, how do I truly know if my model is improving or regressing? These are the questions that make evaluation tough, but crucial.\n\nWith RAG and LLMs evolving rapidly, there wasn't a space to dive deep into these evaluation struggles—until now. That’s why I created this community: to share insights, explore cutting-edge research, and tackle the real challenges of evaluating LLM/RAG systems.\n\nIf you’re navigating similar issues and want to improve your evaluation process, join us.

For those who don't know what RAG is , it's basically combining LLMs with external knowledge sources. This approach lets AI not just generate coherent responses but also tap into a deep well of information, pushing the boundaries of what machines can do.\n\nBut you know what? As amazing as RAG is, I noticed something missing. Despite all the buzz and potential, there isn’t really a go-to place for those of us who are excited about RAG, eager to dive into its possibilities, share ideas, and collaborate on cool projects. I wanted to create a space where we can come together - a hub for innovation, discussion, and support.\n\n",

The text messages are usually about winning money or people trying to start a friendship, but then abruptly start talking about investing. And the crazy part is they fall for it! They keep giving away personal information and it's hard for me to reason why they even bother. So I built Fraud Fighter, a project integrating GPT to detect potential scams. Also has an experimental call monitoring feature.\n\nI originally made it for my parents, but I think the problem affects GenX in general. I'm wondering if this is this something you think GenX would use? Would be cool to have some GenX users.\n\n[https://fraudfighter.app/](https://fraudfighter.app/?_cid=autogpt)\n\nOnly problem is people seem to think the project is a scam and won't try it out, which I guess is understandable. How do you think I can get over that? Anyway, hope some of you try it out.\n\nKeep an eye out for scams, and stay safe!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI don't know if I'm alone here, but my experience trying to build agentic workflows has been a frustrating one: Current frameworks, like LangChain (and its siblings) and Autogen, offer a lot of value but lack the combination that I wanted: A decent UX to create, test and deploy llm-powered agentic workflows. Paid solutions abstract the content from you, and put barriers in your ability to truly own the flows you create.\n\nAt a high level, Project Alice is Autogen (chat) + Autogen Studio (UI) + Langchain (tasks), all in one: It offers a frontend to define, edit and execute tasks and chats, while being able to choose whatever model you want (local or otherwise).\n\n[Repository](https://github.com/MarianoMolina/project_alice)\n\nThis is my initial launch of this project. I honestly have no idea how long I will keep investing time in this, but at the very least: This is an honest attempt at creating an open source framework that is legible/understandable (even if you are not a senior engineer) that you get to use as you wish, make any changes you need (ideally, share them so we can all benefit =), etc.\n\nThe project can be downloaded and used in a few minutes, all you really need is Git, Python, npm, Docker and optionally LM Studio. If you do, you can use local models out of the box. Alternatively, you can also use OpenAI's or Anthropic's APIs.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any and all feedback, and if you feel like contributing, the doors are open!",

            "selftext": "I'm thinking about founding a marketplace of AI agents for developers.\n\nAs far as I know, there is currently no platform for creating and sharing agents: if I build an agent for,say, financial analysis of a fortune 500 company, the only way to share it would be to share the source code. Monetizing it would be extremely hard. On the other hand, if I want to use (multi)-agents to solve a particular problem, I need to create and maintain the code for all the agents, and I'll prbably be reinventing the wheel, as some of the agents would have been created by someone else before.\n\nThe idea is to create a platform where:\n\n1. Devs who create agents could turn them into APIs and easily monetize\n2. Devs who want to use (multi)-agents to automate complex worflows could pick the best agents for certain common tasks from the platform by simply calling the API, instead of having to maintain the code and infra to run them.\n\nKinda like GPT store but from developers to developers. Wdyt? Would you use this?",

                    "body": "I work with AI agents and I don’t think I’d pay for an agent from someone else for several reasons:\n- first, I need to understand how an agent works to use it in any kind of important system, and if I understand how it works, why not just make my own given how simple they are code-wise?\n- second, how are you going to convince me that someone else’s ai agent is worth spending money on vs rolling my own even with no prior knowledge? There aren’t any standardized tests or benchmarks for various agent domains, so there’s no way to prove performance.\n\nThe problem with this idea is that the audience is developers who are building LLM based products, and that audience already knows how to make agents so they’re kind of impossible to sell to. It’s like trying to rent croissant recipes to a baker - yes they’re interested in croissants but they probably won’t rent the recipe from you.\n\nI think there’s enormous entrepreneurial opportunity due to AI but it’s in building businesses that use LLMs rather than trying to control the LLM technology itself. You might spend a collective millennia working on code for sale only to have an outperforming open source version come out and erase most of that investment - sort of like llama3.1 with earlier closed models. Millions of dollars and millennia of compute time essentially becoming evolutionary dead ends.\n\nMeanwhile, if instead of selling LLM tech you start a businesses using LLM tech, every new release will boost your business rather than hurting it - you’ll be aligned in the broader value chain and everything will go smoother.",

For step 1, I of course could code from scratch, but social media listening is a task common to a lot of different use cases/workflows. It would be much easier to pick the best from the community instead of having to develop it. \nMakes sense ?",

I wouldn’t pay for information but you would definitely get my traffic if there was leaderboards to evaluate different approaches, and especially if I could run my own agents against those same benchmarks during development.\n\nOn point 1 re information, yes definitely I consume all the info on AI that I find so if you showed off interesting approaches to AI agents I’d definitely check them out.\n\nOn agents and agentics more broadly, im not sure that they’re going to be the dominant metaphor for LLM systems controllers. My experience is that building external structure around LLMs yields better results than trying to structure within the prompts and more consistency across models too. To that end I wouldn’t build a biz on agents specifically but maybe step back a bit and look at offerings around AI more broadly.\n\nFor example, how about a site where everyone shares tools rather than agents? And the tools can have a leaderboard based on model, eg “so and so’s” web scrape tool is used 88% of the time correct by llama3.1 70b, 67% by mixtral 7x22b and so on.\n\nTools are more valuable than agents because they involve domain expertise on the specific APIs and they involve more testing, input and output formatting, more imports, etc.\n\nI would be more likely to pay once to buy a tool or pack of tools than an agent.",

More than the generic \"Make me a 30-day content plan for X\". \n\nHere's one I use frequently to support with LinkedIn Post writing. Keen to see others!\n\n>**Role:** You are an expert social media content creator specialized in crafting engaging, educational, and semi-casual LinkedIn posts.\n\n>**Task:** Transform blog articles about small business tools into concise LinkedIn posts that increase engagement and educate the audience.\n\n>**Specifics:**\n\n>Tone: Semi-casual\n\n>Content: High-level insights about small business tools\n\n>Keywords: Small business, tool, engagement, educate, LinkedIn\n\n>**Context:**\n\n>The posts should be based on blog article transcripts.\n\n>They should teach the reader about a specific tool for small businesses.\n\n>The goal is to make the posts engaging and enjoyable to read while being informative.\n\n>**Examples:**\n\n>\"Gary Vee's new book proves I'm right. It's affirmation of what I've been saying all along. And that's not surprising, since a lot of what I think is built off listening to people like him. He's just way farther ahead in his thinking because he's been in business for such a long time. So as I've been reading his new book, Day Trading Attention, it's made me think about what our next steps are. I've especially been thinking about how we can start helping our clients with paid ads on top of their organic content. Because all the big brands we want to work with have to do paid ads. So if we can own that, they'll never want to stop working with us. Not only that, but the budget for paid ads is usually 9-10X bigger than the budget for organic content. A lot of that budget goes to the ad platforms, but doing paid ads for our clients could still easily double our revenue. So reading this book has confirmed I'm thinking in the right direction for where I want to take the business next.\"\n\n>\"I'm getting a lot more no's. When we were just doing personal brands, our price point wasn't what it is now. We also had a bit more flexibility in our price because not as many resources went into delivering the work. But now we're going after bigger clients, a lot more time and resources go into those accounts. So I've had to figure out what price is high enough that it's worth taking them on, but not so much that we're just taking the piss. Part of that is thinking about the value we can bring to their business and what that's worth to them. Then we have to see whether their budget matches up with that. The easiest way to do this is just asking what their budget is. Then I have to decide whether it's something we can do for them at that price. And I have to hold my ground, because the level of service we offer costs what it costs. If that means we get more no's, that's ok.\"\n\n>**Emotion Prompting:**\n\n>\"This task is vital to my career. By creating these LinkedIn posts, I aim to increase engagement and educate my audience, which is crucial for building brand awareness and attracting new clients.\"\n\n>**Chain of Thought Prompting:**\n\n>Identify the key insights from the blog article about the small business tool.\n\n>Craft a hook to grab the reader’s attention.\n\n>Summarize the tool’s benefits in a concise and engaging way.\n\n>Encourage interaction by asking a question or prompting a discussion.\n\n>**Notes and Tweaks:**\n\n>Ensure each post is no more than 200 words.\n\n>Use a conversational and relatable tone to connect with the audience.\n\n>Include relevant hashtags and a call-to-action to boost engagement.",

So, the best they can really do is hallucinate and the worst is to generate code for old versions of the library, leaving me wasting hours debugging.\n\nThis field evolves too fast and new libraries keep popping every other day. There needs to be some sort of code generator that can help you get upto speed with these new libraries. One way of implementing such a code generator would be to retrieve related chunks from the documentation of the library and feed them as context to the LLM.\n\nIf anyone here has used something like that then please enlighten me.",

Magentic is an easy way to use decorators to create functions that return structured output from the LLM. \n* GPT-4o by OpenAI as LLM\n* E2B is sandboxed env for securely running untrusted code in the cloud.\n* The example is in Python.\n\nCode: [https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook/blob/main/examples/magentic-code-interpreter/magentic\\_code\\_interpreter.ipynb](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook/blob/main/examples/magentic-code-interpreter/magentic_code_interpreter.ipynb)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryc2h2s60s5d1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=c10c46e72e8a70575659865b9069b4fd74a0c24f\n\n  \n",
