That's why I made Sorted App. You can easily use your Open API key and select the folder you want to organize, and you're all set. It also has automatic sorting, which is especially helpful for your downloads folder. I have tested it for folder sizes as large as 2500 files and it has worked perfectly. Not going to lie, it has taken a ton of tweaking and optimizing. The files are only moved into other folders so there is no deleting of files.

Well, there aren't many AI transcription applications out there today that allow you to download and save your data **locally while ensuring GDPR compliance**.\n\nHere's where you come in. I'm still learning, and I'm excited to share a sneak peek of what we're working on – ScriptMe Lite. Please keep in mind, the design isn't quite finished yet, but we're focusing on functionality first.\n\n**Your thoughts guide my journey!**\n\n* What features are a must-have for you?\n* Is there a function you've always wished for in such a tool?\n\nThe thought is it to be free with an 75% accuracy and if you want a better accuracy there's a payment plan. Pricing is a piece of the puzzle we're solving too. I'd appreciate your input on what you'd consider a fair price for a tool that meets your transcription needs and data security requirements.\n\n**As an intern, your input is incredibly valuable to me, and I genuinely appreciate your thoughts.**\n\nJoin the conversation below, and let's shape ScriptMe Lite together.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4uigqb4siwb1.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=0efa2f66e1ab840e7dc2709bffce5ba9090f3536",

If you're anything like me, you've probably burned through a ton of time and cash trying to set up a website from scratch, host it, and then wrangle it for SEO. I got fed up with the hassle, so I decided to build a platform that would save not just me, but all of us, a boatload of time and money.\n\nEnter CodeDesign.ai, an AI-powered website builder that takes a simple prompt and spins it into a full-on business website or landing page. It hands you the layout, the content, all the images - and then you can either publish it or export it with just a click.\n\nAnd here's the kicker - if you're not vibing with the design, you can regenerate it as many times as you want until you nail that perfect look.\n\n[Enter a prompt to create a website](https://preview.redd.it/szi4izb0speb1.png?width=2094&format=png&auto=webp&s=4058511fd8f4cc2aee34db4fe14eccd25d76ca5b)\n\nI'd love for you to take it for a spin and let me know what you think.

It also has a built-in Compare-feature to analyze and compare multiple prompts and their corresponding results in a user-friendly interface. It also supports the new Function-calling method of OpenAI if you want to learn how to use that!\n\nFeel free to [sign up here](https://www.betterprompt.xyz/) or send me a DM if you have any questions!",
