                    "body": "It's me again, back this time with cover art! I had it commissioned by a pretty cool artists and so here it is, my cover for the foreseeable future. Still, I will be working on getting more images. There are spaces in here that you can see definitely need some flair. But, images don't make the brew playable, and I am proud to say that everything in here has been tested to make a fun boss fight, character interaction, or even and end game goal. \n\nHere's the link to the doc: [https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SyhPLhOKa1p4](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SyhPLhOKa1p4)\n\nLet me start with Lwa. This character is my own. You can obviously see it shares my publication name on the Homebrewery. I wanted to make a character like Tasha or Mordenkainen, who was powerful in their own right, and held a deep connection to the worlds around them. That led to a lot of trial and error. Especially because, how the heck do you make a bard boss without the inspiration feature?  \nWell, here it is. The artifacts in Lwa's possession allow her to summon spirits of warriors from other realms. I know that the cap on this feature may seem lacking. Sure, it could be busted in some cases, but Lwa is designed to be a higher leveled boss fight. A party would easily steamroll her summons with proper hits, especially as their hp is so low.\n\nThe Artifacts themselves have their own unique flavor. I really hope I can get art of them commissioned in the future. A violin that acts as a shield, and a violin bow that acts as a rapier. This idea has been the basis of two magical item sets in my campaign. This one is the first, and is the only item/ item set strong enough to be labeled an artifact. Some might argue with that, and that's fine. Just remember, they're one of a kind, give some fun features, and together, they give a few summons as bonus actions, without the use of a spell slot.\n\nNormal legendary item things.\n\n(Also, the \"Grandmasters Rebuke\" is the same as Lwa's \"Grandmasters Counter\". I just realized while going over that was one wording error. But that is an easy fix)\n\nNow, Subclasses! When I first published college of Myth, I got a recommendation to make a subclass based around the transformations in one of its features. That is exactly what I did. Now, starting out, you can choose whether or not to use these empowerment. In combat, they might last for one good turn, but they add quite a bit of roleplay flavor. Some, like Titan's hammer or the infernal tango, give abilities that could be used in travel or dungeon crawls. Titans hammer has the target grow by one size. that also increases the carrying capacity. Infernal tango gives devils sight. There was a point where I wanted to tie it closer to Celestials Tears, and use hp to teleport. But I think devils sight is much more thematic.  \nIn order to balance this. When you empower an ally, you can no longer inspire them. That is of course, until the next rest. This limit sort of disappears at level 6. But still, you will never be able to empower allies twice in a rest cycle. Other abilities are based around other monsters. The only one that isn't based on a traditional monster or race is Titan, which can easily be subbed for giant.\n\n  \nNext. I didn't want to get rid of my initial bard subclass. Instead, I went back through with some new ideas, focusing on bringing about the lovechild of College of swords and College of eloquence. This bard is meant to be a battle bard. I tried to make its inspiration bonuses a lot more suited to dishing out damage, as well as being a pain to your enemies when it comes to rolling attacks or saving throws. Vocal support is the big part here, but the bread and butter of this subclass comes with the tempo effect. By level 14, you can give an ally a free crit, and turn that into an extra turn. Crits are... strong, at times. It's good to have someone in the party that can make those epic moments happen. So, you decide.\n\nFinally, spells. I fixed up many of them. For starters, Piercing cadence is scaled better thanks to some nice suggestions in its initial post. Blissful Aria doesn't have the drawback it used to have. And of course, Dissonant Blast now deafens instead of stunning.\n\nI hope you all like these brews. This is my first publication of a full on multi-page brew like this. The next one I have coming will either be mainly subclasses, or an entirely new realm/demiplane which focuses on the Warlock subclass I previously posted. I'm hoping to patch that up a bit when I drop the full realm, but it depends on what I get to first. So, until next time.\n\nI await the feedback with bated breath.",

Today I'm taking a crack at expanding the Social Pillar beyond the realm of the simple Charisma check with two additions: Contacts, and Favor!\n\nContacts are friendly NPCs that you establish a bond with over the course of downtime. Favor, meanwhile, is a new resource gained by spending downtime to earn goodwill. You can then use favor in place of rolling on a Charisma check, to create a social opportunity through a contact, or spreading propaganda about yourself, a friend, or an enemy. \n\nThis project was inspired by an effort to overhaul the preexisting Carousing downtime activity, which I felt didn't really have enough substance. My hope is that this system will be a great addition for players who want to explore the world of intrigue or who want a way to enjoy the social pillar even without a high Cha score. Please let me know what you think!\n\nHomebrewery Link: [https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/GLEdOGL2lowo](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/GLEdOGL2lowo)",

Numerically, the classes should align well with standard 5e classes in terms of power level, but you should expect a slightly higher level of complexity, a few nonstandard play patterns, and a few unexpected design decisions.\nI am actively working on this project, so you can watch for balance patches for parts that are over- or under-performing.

It is a fun class but *very* different from the other two.",

                    "body": "Hi! I'm currently playing your subclass in a three players game, and I'm having a blast. My party mates are a Land Druid and a very frail Arcane Trickster, so I went Earth to be the tank, with occasional aid from the druid's wolf companion.\n\nLast session we arrived at a location, on top of a mountain, with an everburning flame, and then levelled up to level 6, so I decided to choose Fire as secondary root.\n\nI really like the change of \"Stone Stomp\", especially the bonus action part: it wasn't really worth taking before, now I may consider it for level 11.\n\nI am conflicted about the additional proficiency: on one hand, it looks like it's redundant and \"too much\" for novice level, on the other hand, even if a charachter ends up taking one level in all roots, it's not much more than what is given by some official subclasses. I think it's fine, as long as it's played as written: if a character's already got the proficiency, they shouldn't be allowed to trade it for a different one. That way, it keeps itself balanced across all four roots.\n\nI don't dislike the new Flaming Strike but, after Extra Attack is unlocked, there's a situation in which you hit an enemy with both your normal attacks, and you have to choose whether appliyng Flaming Strike to your second attack, or try your luck with flurry of blows, potentially missing both of them. Analysis paralysis. I wouldn't change it, though. Having the choice allows for tactical flexibility, and has more pros than cons.\n\nOne thing that I would include is for Flaming Strike to apply to attacks made with Produce Flames. I know Produce Flames is meant to be just a little more than a ribbon, but I don't think that making it more reliable in terms of damage will make it the main source of damage.\n\nCan you please share your reasoning behind Ball of Blaze having disadvantage? I'm comparing it to Magic Missile and, for an equivalent cost (one first level slot = 2 ki points), Magic Missile deals on average 10.5 damage, while Ball of Blaze 11.5 (14 with my modification) ONLY IF IT HITS, 6-7 granted damge on a miss. Then sure, it scales at level 17 and only takes half of an attack action, but the only ways one would need to use this is eithe when stuck at range, or for unavoidable damage and concentration checks, so you would need to realistically use more ki points to use Ball of Blaze again, and that would equate to casting Magic Missile at third level. Magic Missile is also force damage. Any way I turn it, Ball of Blaze having disadvantage seems overcomplicated and not really needed.\n\nOne thing I must say, I really like your formatting and art style. But with reddit one can't zoom on an image on browser, it must be opened in another table just to be read properly, and even then, just one page at the time. You should really provide a pdf link, it would make it much easier to consult.",

Has Novice earth been effective and fun to play? \n\nThe additional proficiency was to make those playing the avatar build feel more like a wise savant and Jack of all trades. I chose abilities that wouldn't get too much attention but fit the element's vibe. I do agree it may be a little cluttered though, so I'm not sure that it'll stay in the next update. \n\nI'm glad you don't dislike the new Flaming Strike, fire has definitely been the element I've had the most difficulty balancing and making fun to play. I'm still a little worried that it's too much damage, but I felt like the last iteration was underwhelming, so if you have additional feedback from your play test down the line I would be very interested to hear it. I'm still trying to find a way to make Burning Strike work; it doesn't feel quite there yet. \n\nI'll probably take your idea of allowing them to add Flaming Strike to produce flame. It could definitely help make it more viable.\n\nMy reasoning for Ball of Blaze was mostly for flavor. The idea is shooting a fireball in a burst of rage that reduces accuracy but burns so hot it will still damage the target if it misses. Plus it adds to fire's ability to concentration check casters, so that automatic damage felt important to the kit. I see your point though; it's probably not strong enough. Do you think reducing it to one ki point and adding burning would make it worthwhile? \n\nI wasn't aware of the problem with zooming in on the computer. I'll definitely get a PDF link up as soon as possible. \n\nThanks again for playing my subclass and giving notes! It means a lot",

One note I'd make is that magic items don't ever have recharges tied to rest, and it's generally implied already that you don't have to use a spell slot or material components due to being a magic item. I'd probably change the second paragraph to read as follows:\n\n\"While wearing this ring, you can use an action to cast fireball or ice storm (save DC 17) from it. Once you cast either spell, you cannot cast it again this way until the next dawn.\"",

More specifically, the shattered remains of Pashama, the Goddess of Nature, felled during the War of Eternity, a conflict so catastrophic it marked the end of the Pantheon -- and of all Gods, for that matter. Yet, nature survived; Pashama, in her infinite foresight, split her divinity in eight sacred blooms, which would ensure the survival of all creatures tied to her domain. Delve into these mystical biomes with the mysterious Alesthesian, Wielder of the Green Bloom, and discover the plants and beasts that protect Nature in all its forms!\n\nAbout the Celymbrae in particular, well, what can we say; we like the Myconids very much, and we wanted to make our own version! No death shrooms, this time.\n\nMore previews about this particular book coming on our [**subreddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/codexofstrings)! Join, we are pretty cool :3\n\nThere's also a bunch of content on our [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/codexofstrings). Drop us a follow!\n\nCheers and Happy Threadseeking!",

With 18 new subclasses, 50 new spells or ‘spellprograms,’ 24 new enemy stat blocks from CR ½ to CR 30, 28 new vehicles, 28 new armors, 80 new weapons (including melee armaments and firearms), a whopping 251 new items ranging from an entirely new equipment list, armor modules, weapon modules, cybernetic enhancements, narcotics, and magic items, alongside new character options and alternate rules, this compendium has got you covered!\n\nSince Reddit only allows for 20 images per carousel, I will be back soon so all of this can be released to you for free here on Reddit, but if you want the whole thing now, or you want to support a small D&D creator, you can find it on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/koathedm)! Not only will you get the entirety of this compendium that I've been working on for months now, but you also get access to all of my posts early and you get to see the most updated versions of my posts as I get feedback from y'all!

A burning candle rises from the eye of the axe producing dim light in a 10-foot radius sphere around you. Melted wax from the candle constantly drips down the blade, but any that falls away disappears when it hits the floor. The candle is magically enchanted to never stop burning while also never shrinking in size allowing it to constantly produce wax for the weapon. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\n\nThe wax that drips down the handle coats your hands during use of this weapon making it impossible for you to be disarmed by any means.\n\nWhen you critically succeed on an attack roll using this weapon, wax flies from the blade coating the creature in the quickly hardening substance. The creature must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or become restrained by the wax for 1 minute. The creature can use an action on its turn to try to break free and reattempt the saving throw, becoming unrestrained on a successful attempt.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to see more of our items you can check us out on our [**Website**](https://www.abyssalbrews.com), [**Twitter**](https://www.twitter.com/abyssalbrews), [**Pinterest**](https://www.pinterest.com/abyssalbrews), [**Tumblr**](https://www.tumblr.com/abyssalbrews), [**Bluesky**](https://bsky.app/profile/abyssalbrews.com) or [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/abyssalbrews) where we post them regularly.

It makes it hard for me to find the weapon's details quickly. I think it is much better practice to have flavor text up top, and simply express the flavor in the mechanics of the item, instead of mixing mechanics and descriptive flavor text.\n\n  \nedit: Also, great name",

Rather than banning its use l instead decided to rewrite it, my main goals where to remove the need for players to know what abilities a monster has either via metagaming or being shown by their DM, and to bring it more in line with existing power word spells by removing the saving throw in the original spell and better fleshing out the mechanics of the spell while not making it crazy broken. I would attach a screen shot of the original for comparison but l'd rather not risk flying too close to the sun by reposting published KP material, but it can be easily found on 5eSRD.",

At that level, you are expending a 7th-level slot to deplete a *minimum* of 7 levels of spell slots, and average of 10, and a maximum of 13.\n\nSure, if the enemy can cast two 7th+ level spells per day, they lose those two and nothing else, but the amount is still staggering.\n\nAlso, most monsters with the spellcasting feature don't have spell slots, they have uses per day of the spells regardless of their level, so you might want to review the wording.\n\nShutting down X/turn or recharge abilities sounds cool, but like another commenter said, this is essentially *Power Word: Trivialise* since it removes most troublesome abilities/powers and makes the monster nothing but a meatbag for several turns. And if it fails, you wasted your action but no spell slots.\n\nAnd yes, it's a 7th-level slot you're using, but it's still really powerful.\n\nFirst, I would add a HP limit. Second, I wouldn't target Legendary Resistances. Yes, they are annoying, but they exist for the very reason to prevent spells from save-or-suck at the monster.\n\nThe idea is nice though.",

This spell takes away all the mechanics and rules that make solo bosses viable or fun.

You can identify its contents by its swirling contents.\n\nWhen you find this bottle, its contents appears as one of the items below. As a Bonus Action, you can upset the contents of this flask by shaking it vigorously. Roll a d10 to determine the contents:\n\n1. Acid\n2. Basic Poison\n3. Alchemist’s Fire\n4. Holy Water\n5. Potion of Healing\n6. Potion of Hill Giant Strength\n7. Elixir of Health\n8. Potion of Growth\n9. Minty Mouthwash\n10. Potion of Speed\n\nEach time you shake the flask beyond the first each day, roll a d10. On a 1, the contents permanently changes into a warm and tasty but otherwise nonmagical soup.

I honestly think it could go either way, however because of the Study action, I personally think it is less punitive for action economy if you always know the potion’s contents. I like to think that the liquid kinda exudes outside of the bottle harmlessly, but enough to make it apparent to what’s” inside”. If you have fun and chaotic, go for it, blindly toss that Potion of Healing on the rampaging owl bear.  \n\nPotions and adventuring gear are usually all-or-nothing in their design as far as I'm aware. You either have a full health potion or nothing at all, so it can't be partially filled. Once you uncork the bottle and pour a little bit out, it is permanently fixed. I do want to make a higher rarity wild magic alchemy jug that probably does more of what you're asking.\n\nI've added a comment thread and made a newer edit to address your question. I can also see a variant in which when you find the bottle it is simply inert water until shaken, and reverts to inert water each day at dawn. \n\nI would love to see more options or variants, please share!",

                    "body": "[GMBinder link](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-OBHJjbYBnrNwdv2n9M3)\n___\n\nGood day, all:\n\nI've always found the weapons in 5e to be mechanically redundant (battleax vs longsword) and a little bland. As a part of the comprehensive overhaul in our new Unbound Realms project, weapons have been massively overhauled. Dozens of new properties are tweaked and/or introduced. Additionally, weapons are built using a calculator, which allows easy generation of new weapons or customization of existing ones for your table.\n\nI'd be really interested in your experiences with weapons from 5e and other systems and any feedback you have on these rules.\n\n___\n\nBecause Unbound Realms is a comprehensive overhaul, some aspects of these rules require clarification that would exist in other parts of the book. You can find those clarifications below.\n\n#### Partial Weapons\nCertain classes and traits grant a limited proficiency in martial weapons. Rather than reiterating this restriction in every class, instead they are defined as Partial Weapons, though this name is subject to change.\n\n#### Variant: Weapon Quality\nFor realms where disparate weapon technology levels exist, this variant rule will offer suggestions on how to best represent that difference.\n\n#### Variant: Tracking Ammunition\nOversimplification, but just don't track mundane ammunition unless you're in an area where it would make sense to do so, such as stranded in a desert. Still track reload for guns, however.\n\n#### Normal Weapon Damage\nCertain weapon properties might refer to normal weapon damage. This is the damage dealt by the weapon itself, which will typically be the weapon's damage die/dice + the wielder's governing ability modifier, but not anything the wielder would add themselves like a Divine Smite.\n\n#### Arrow, Bolt, Bullet, Cartridge, and Cell\nRather than the single ammunition property, ranged weapons now stipulate exactly what ammo they use based on their property.\n\n#### Auto, Burst, Overwhelm, Pierce, and Rapid\nBurst, overwhelm, and rapid properties offer ways to attack while avoiding AC. They instead call for a Reflex saving throw (think Dexterity saving throw), making them more effective against higher AC targets.\n\nAuto forces weapons to use those modes if they have them, which helps represent something like a gatling gun.\n\n#### Close-Quarters\nThis property is fun for weapons that should be more effective against creatures who are Grappled or Restrained, pairing very well with weapons like a Net or a Bolas.\n\n#### Dexterity and Strength\nThese properties enable weapons that are more powerful than others, but require a dual ability investment to utilize properly.\n\n#### Disguised and Hidden\nThese properties grant a nice flavorful bonus to weapons that could easily be portrayed as something else. You wouldn't part an old man from his walking stick, would you?\n\n#### Double\nThis property represents weapons that have a blade on each end and can be used with Double-Weapon Fighting. DWF is similar to TWF, except you add your ability to the bonus action damage roll instead of the attack roll. The appropriate fighting practice would negate the attack roll penalty.\n\n#### Fixed\nThis property helps represent weapons that should be difficult to disarm and otherwise shouldn't require a hand to wield.\n\n#### Loading and Powerful\nLoading in 5e is an amazingly flavorful property that is mechanically bland. Our updated version lets/forces you to dump your extra attacks into one big one that, effectively, deals double+ damage. Powerful provides a melee counterpart.\n\n#### Luminous\nThis property is specifically for melee energy weapons, which emit a minor glow.\n\n#### Point-Blank\nThis property is designed to work for weapons that should be usable within 5 feet of a hostile creature.\n\n#### Physical and Mental\nThe physical property replaces finesse, allowing it work on both melee and ranged weapons and also potentially enable using Con offensively. The mental counterpart allows the use of Int, Wis, or Cha for your attack and damage rolls with the weapon, enabling builds that might not otherwise be available.\n\n#### Quick\nFormerly light, also works for DWF, discussed in the Double property.\n\n#### Returning\nThis property is designed for weapons that return to their owner when thrown, helping to enable throwing weapon builds that don't want to rely on having dozens of darts.\n\n#### Reload\nThis property is intended to be exclusively* for guns, granting them a little extra power compared to bows but with a noticeable drawback.\n\n#### Scoped\nThis property increases the normal and long range of ranged weapons and adds a third range: close range. Attacks against creatures within close range have disadvantage.\n\n#### Silent\nSome weapons shouldn't necessarily reveal the attacker, which is represented by this property.\n\n#### Projector Cannon\nUnlike normal weapons, the damage amount and type are determined by their ammunition. Projector cannons fire in a cone or line, dealing damage to all targets within the affected area.\n\n#### Rocket Launcher\nUnlike normal weapons, the damage amount and type are determined by their ammunition. Rocket launchers fire... rockets, that both deal damage on a hit and then explode to damage an area.\n\n#### Wrist Launcher\nUnlike normal weapons, the damage amount and type are determined by their ammunition. Wrist launchers can fire a variety of ammunition types, such as darts, projector cannisters (baby projector cannon), missiles (baby rocket launcher) and more.\n\n___\n\nLike what you see?

These types of highly unbalanced races, with both amazing strengths and devastating weaknesses, are not easy to pull off, but you've done a fairly decent job.

For example, how often will you be impaled \"through the heart\" with a wooden piercing weapon? And do PCs really spend that much time in running water?",

Yes divine smites are good, but having free rein to run all around the battle field giving everybody your aura is really strong. What’s even more busted is the cast a spell section. Casting an action spell as a reaction is insanely good. Especially because it’s a reaction you can take ‘Whenever you want’.  If your Paladin ever multiclassed into sorcerer or bard, or even when they themselves get high enough level spells, that removal of action economy is gonna make them a powerhouse. I would maybe remove that point and also make it so that they move half their speed instead of their entire speed.",

This campaign is mostly theatre of mind so I think the logistics are a little different, might have to change the movement.\n\nI added the spell part because my paladin enjoys casting bless with her action, and I know for a fact she's never going to multiclass (and I could always tell her not to abuse this), but for campaigns where that's an issue, definitely something worth considering.\n\nThis party only has 3 people, maybe aura of protection bouncing is still ok since the paladin has to choose if the frontline sorcerer or the backline wizard gets it, even if it's bouncing around... Or maybe I'll just change that",

                    "body": "# Cloud Hopper’s Keg\n\n*Very Rare Adventuring Gear (Brewer’s Supplies), Requires Proficiency with Brewer’s Supplies, Requires Attunement*\n\nThe Cloud Hopper’s Keg is the upgraded version of the Hopper’s Keg, it keeps all of its original stats, but its ability check bonus is increased to +4, the Hopping Brew’s potency is increased and it gains the new Foam Clouds feature\n\nThis item is a special oaken keg that weighs 10 pounds and can hold two gallons of liquid. Beer inside the Keg doesn’t increase the Keg’s weight, so it will weigh the same as if there was no beer inside.\n\n* When used as part of Brewer’s Supplies, it gives a +4 bonus on ability checks made with them.\n\n**Adventuring Microbrewery.** This small magical keg is enchanted so that its fermenting process can be hastened by the attuned creature’s own metabolism. Each time you finish a long rest, you can expend one of your Hit Dice to immediately finish the fermentation process of the beer inside the keg, making it ready for consumption.\n\n**Hops and Wort(h)** As part of a short rest, you can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Brewer’s Supplies) check to begin a special magical brewing process, requiring at least 10 gp worth of ingredients. On a success, a special kind of beer called “Hopping Brew” starts fermenting in the keg. Once Hopping Brew is finished, a creature can drink a pint of it and gain these effects for 1 hour:\n\n* They can jump up to their full movement speed and without requiring a running start. They can also combine the effects of both a long jump and a high jump.\n* Twice per the duration of the effect, they can use their bonus action to jump as far as they can, without expending any of their movement.\n* Twice per the duration of the effect, they can use their reaction to go under the effects of the Feather Fall spell.\n* All fall damage is calculated as if the creature fell from a 30 ft. lower height.\n\nDrinking the pint usually requires at least 1 minute, but a creature can use their action to drink it all at once, they must however also succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, becoming poisoned for 1 minute on a failure.\n\nDrinking another pint of Hopping Brew while already under its effects will only  increase the effects duration, but will not recharge any expended abilities.\n\nThe Hopping Brew only keeps its magical effects for 24 hours after being finished.\n\nHopping Brew is a pale lager with unbelievably frothy and bubbly foam that doesn’t settle down, but instead constantly rises up and forms small Ale s that fly off into the sky.\n\n**Foam Clouds (Recharge 5-6)** As a bonus action, you can tamper with the keg’s tap and make it let out a cloud of foam that appears on an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you and that lasts for 1 minute. The cloud is a disc with a 20 foot radius and thickness of 5 feet, that can float in the air without falling.\n\n* As long as the cloud remains, you can use your  action to move it 30 feet in any direction of your choice, along with all creatures and objects standing on it.\n* Creatures take no fall damage if they fall on a Foam Cloud.\n* Creatures can move on the cloud as if it was solid ground, but it’s considered difficult terrain.\n* The cloud can be destroyed, it is an object with AC 10 and 50 Hit Points.\n* When this feature is recharged, you can also use your action to instead use it to create the effects of a Fog Cloud spell at a point within 60 feet, but lasting only 1 minute.\n\nIf you like what we make please consider supporting our humble Tavern.

We'll see where the journey takes me, if it will be like the Mastery spells I did there will probably be feats that allow you to cast double school spells, but for now until I have more under my belt, I didn't give any specifications. You can treat this as either single one of the schools if you prefer.\n\nWith that out of the way, the concept for this is straightforward, but the execution is a bit complex in the moving parts and I'm open to modifying stuff based on feedback.\n\nI played with multiple versions and this is what I landed on. For interrogating a single individual Suggestion is better, while this is better if you want to affect multiple people. \n\nFor larger events the food would probably be purified before to prevent any sort of poisoning, so you would need to be creative with how and when you can apply this.\n\nI'm eager to hear thoughts and feedback of any sort!",

                    "body": "I like the concept of this spell, plays into tropes of truth serum and using drink to loosen lips. My main issues with this current draft are the many restrictions on how to use it. Since it takes a minute to cast, you need access to the target's drink for a long enough time that they would likely notice your interference unless you are bringing a drink to them, in which case a target may not be willing to accept a drink from you. It's tied to a Con save, a save monsters tend to be quite good at. It can be bypassed by two decently common condition immunities. It requires a consumed gold cost per cast (which scales with upcasting). And it only gives one guaranteed truthful answer. \n\nCompare this to Zone of Truth, a level down. While it does not compel a creature to speak like this spell does, it's a simple action to cast, targets a Charisma save (which monsters tend to be bad at), doesn't require any gold spent, and it prevents untruthful answers for the entire duration.\n\nHere's how I think you should update this: change the cast time to an action (but keep the ritual cast option), remove the gold cost material (or at least the scaling), and change the save to a Wis save. I think keeping additional compelled answers locked to upcasting is reasonable. With these changes, this spell should be a bit more easy to use and approachable. Hope this is helpful!",

A sort of force a creature to make a big reveal in front of many people without being very direct as with Suggestion. \n\nStill, I'm feeling like if you have situations where this spell a bit stronger would break your game you can just not allow it at the table.

                    "body": "I really love the idea of fleshing out aquatic environments with fun monsters. But My kingdom for some beasts with dynamic attacks!\n\nAlmost all of these are really wanting for some interesting attack options. Let’s take a look at the giant reel eel. The only attack it has is really really basic. Just a bite with a big chunk of slashing damage. But we could have something so much cooler for a giant eel! The bite could grapple on a hit, opening up grab-and-go tactics for this creature. \n\nAn eel swimming up and biting your wizard is bad news. An eel swimming up, biting your wizard, and then dragging them off to gobble them down is really bad news, and creates a crisis for your players to solve. \n\nOne more nitpick before I go: the attack bonus for the eel (and likely some more of these) isn’t calculated right. Monster attacks work a lot like PC attacks. They have a base stat (like STR), and add that modifier with the monster’s proficiency bonus. The proficiency bonus is determined by the CR. The minimum prof bonus is +2, and it scales in the same way that PC prof bonuses do - just look at a class progression table and substitute CR for player level to determine the prof bonus. \n\nYou’re free to ignore that convention, of course- but my guess is you weren’t aware there was a formula for that stuff (?). DnD is not terribly good at making that calculation clear to homebrewers. While we are free to break rules when we brew, we should at least be aware of them before we break em.",

Where I messed up was in failing to update the stat line properly for some of the monsters. Since the ability score is its own layer in the template document I sometimes forget to go in and update it once all the text is finished. If we look at the damage numbers on the eels we see its 2d10 + 5, so the Strength stat should be 20 there, which explains the attack bonus of +8 (+5 from Strength, +3 from proficiency bonus. Athletics also seems to have missed.\n\nAll that to say, this is less me not knowing how things work, and more me just missing inconsistencies, which is still not great, but is an easier fix. I'll try and update things over on Patreon since I can take down and reupload there, but Reddit is unfortunately stuck with what I posted. How so many typos snuck through, I have no idea and it's half making me wonder if I'm not using the final versions of these, so I'm off to do some digging around my folders.\n\nAs for the dynamic attacks, I'm with you there. I just wanted to keep these simple and on par with existing beast options, which are all very simple creatures. I couldn't resist giving them a bit more sauce, but I tried to keep in line with the default for the most part. The leviathan eel and lampreys may be more your style.",

I do think you should specify whether any game statistics or access to features change.

A man in a dark cloak entered, his eyes scanning the room. Around his neck, the light caught on a silver chain adorned with teeth. I knew it instantly: the chain of command.\n\nThey said the chain could make hardened warriors drop their blades with a whisper. And there were rumors of its past wearers; the most famous being a bard who used it for cheap parlor tricks at hypnosis shows, making wide-eyed drunks cluck like chickens. There were darker tales too. One of a warlord who used the chain to command a horde of goblins. When I saw the man wearing it now, I couldn’t help but wonder if he had such grim ambitions.\n\nA drunk by the bar slurred something about the cloaked figure’s mother, and I winced. The man touched the silver chain. His voice cut through the tavern like a knife. “Kneel,” he said, and the drunk’s knees buckled before he even had time to curse. Everyone went silent, eyes wide, watching as the drunk collapsed, not in pain but in sudden submission.\n\nWhat happens when a tool like that falls into hands it shouldn’t? I remembered hearing that some towns had given chains to their guards to calm brawls before they turned into riots. But magic like that warps purpose; what begins as a tool to keep peace often ends as a weapon for control. The cloaked man turned and for a moment our eyes met. There was steel there, but a weariness as well. Then, as quietly as he had come, he was gone and the tavern was glad of it.\n\nCheck out our blog, [The Goblin Coach](https://goblincoach.com/), for more free 5e content!",

Jinx from Arcane, Rocket Raccoon, Ratchet and Clank, the Borderlands series, High on Life, and that one scene from The Fifth Element. \n\nUnlike most Wild Magic subclasses I will be creating, this subclass deals mainly with two kinds of wild magic tables. A wild magic surge when you create the weapon, creating an unpredictable permanent factor in the weapon as to your jury rigging point. There's also the smaller D4 wild magic table which you use to produce effects channeled from other classes. It's as if the artificer can kind of mitigate and hone the chaos of Wild Magic into more discreet results.",

Darn direct translation.)\n\nWe thought about creating a warrior subclass that really brought versatility into the mix and was also fun to play, with varying options when it came to how creative the player can get. In the end, we believe its quite entertaining to play and see be played! Of course, both of us are new to homebrewing and no matter how much we talk about it we won’t get past our own opinions. Please bear in mind our lack of experience when reading the subclass, and it would be incredibly helpful if we could get some constructive feedback. Anyway, I hope you enjoy exposing those muscles!\n\nEdit: This subclass is compatible with DnD 2024 and might work better there thanks to the new grappling rules, but really it wasn't created with any particular version in mind. Go crazy!",

So a 66% chance of a bad thing happening, or 2 out of 3 rolls.\n\nOdds are very good that it will last one combat, maybe even one round, and needs to be reforged every time for a steep price and a lengthy time.  And a volcano.\n\nThe high reward is not enough for the high risk, in my opinion.\n\nMost magic items break on a 1 in 20 roll.\n\nSuggest changing it to the 1 in 20 chance to break, keeping the reforge part, and the fire dmg to yourself could be a curse that is caused when they miss the attack roll by 5 or something.  Or it deals that dmg on a crit, which the sword gives 15% chance to do and continues the theme of critical hits.",

                    "body": "Hello there!\n\nTo be honest, the College of Folklore is a bit of a headscratcher. Wis-mod pages means your storybook has a max of 5 pages, which aside from being funny means you can use up to 5 *Ancient Stories* per day (nearly twice that at 6th level, according to the usual 2 SR/day balance assumption).\n\nThis starts out fine and in one case fairly weak - 5 TempHP isn't all that much, you could honestly raise that to your Bardic Inspiration die + your Wis or Cha modifier.\n\nHowever, there are several *Ancient Stories* which are really powerful, and some oddly worded.\n\n*Stories of the Wanderer* is essentially a *Find the Path* spell, except it lasts 1 minute, which isn't enough to travel far, but it's also not just an instant \"this is where we should go\". I'd make it a brief flash of insight, rather than a 1-minute guide that doesn't actually last long enough to guide you anywhere.\n\n*Ancient History* and *Monster Lore* are both fine.\n\n*Monster Stories* is oddly worded. Instead of \"for one minute a creature who can hear you...\", why not say \"Choose a creature that can hear you. For the next minute, the creature has advantage on the first attack it makes against the recalled monster each turn.\"\n\n*Otherworldly Tales* also is a 7th-level spell, *Plane Shift*, cast at 14th level up to 9 times a day for free (5 base, +2 per SR). Once per day would be fine. Several times per day... is a bit redudant.\n\nSimilar, but different issue with *Hunger of Hadar* in *Stories of the Void*. You can stack multiple casts of it since none of them require Concentration and last for the duration. Having 9 casting per day, and stackable, is pretty powerful.\n\nYou should limit that too. If only to prevent stacking it.\n\nSimilar issue with *Tales of the Elemental Plane*. Not only do you not specify the action cost, but this means that if you burn all 5 your available spells in 5 turns, you and all your allies will have +5d8 elemental damage to your first attack for the next 5 turns.\n\nYes, it takes a while to set it up, but it is strictly better than *Elemental Weapon*, which only targets 1 weapon and has Concentration.\n\nFor this one too I would say you cannot stack the effects together. In fact, for all of them, I would say that reusing the same *Ancient Story* ends the effect of the previous one. So if you use *Stories of the Void* twice, the first one ends.\n\nOf course, different *Ancient Story* can work together, or the *Story of the Hero* would never be used.\n\n*Capturing Stories* and *Greater Legend Lore* are both fine.\n\n***To be continued in another comment...***",

                    "body": "***Part 2***\n\n***College of Dissonance***\n\nAs for the other subclass...\n\n*Discordant Music* is fine for the first half, and not fine for the second. Adding damage to any spell that offers a save is already a really good feature. For one, it massively increases your *Vicious Mockery* damage.\n\nBut turning all spell damage into psychic is over the top. Psychic is one of the best damage types in the game, right after force. Getting *Transmute Spell* Metamagic for free is a lot.\n\nYes, you are limited to the amount of *Bardic Inspiration* dice you have, but at 5th level you begin getting them back on a SR, and you start having plenty, meaning you can use *Discordant Music* a whole lot more.\n\nThis feature has the issue of being perfectly good at 4th level or lower, but made too powerful at 5th level due to getting too many uses.\n\nHow about this - instead of the damage-conversion half of the feature, what if you remove it and add another feature? A feature that once per short rest, whenever a creature fails an Int, Wis or Cha save against one of your spells, you can force it to make a single weapon attack against a target it can reach in a bout of madness. Creatures immune to charm are immune to this effect. And you get a second use per SR at 10th or 14th level.\n\n*Nightmarish Echoes* is probably missing the 6th-level mark, since there's no 6th-level feature. It's fine as an ability, and very much not combat-useful since it takes a minute, but it's good for RP and utility, especially since the targets don't know you did it on purpose!\n\nI would add that regardless of whether they succeed or fail the save, they are immune to your *Nightmarish Echoes* for 24 hours, though, and you can use it once per SR.\n\nHaving a once/LR ability fizzle and do nothing because of a good save really sucks.\n\n*Phantasmal Killer* is good, but now that you specify you don't use a spell slot... does that mean *Detect Thoughts* does use a spell slot?\n\nI would just say that if they fail the save, you can read their thoughts as if through the spell *Detect Thoughts*, instead of making you cast *Detect Thoughts* and giving them another save.\n\nAs for *Shared Psychosis*...\n\nI'm sorry, but I just don't see any use for this feature. If you are alone, you are debuffing yourself just as much as your enemies. If you are in a party, you are debuffing your party just as much as the enemy. Unless your party can immediately cast *Lesser Restoration* on all of you, you don't actually get any bonus.\n\nSure, if your party can just cover their ears and not suffer from it, it's alright, but then you can just say that you can *choose* which creatures you target.\n\nAnd in that case, not giving a save feels very unfair, since you would incapacitate yourself (while protected by your allies) and incapacitate the enemies, who aren't as prepared, with no save.\n\nI can understand what you were going for here - a mass psychosis that is really risky to use and should be used with caution - but to be honest it's either a \"sucks to suck\" for everyone, or a free \"sucks for the enemies\" if the party can be excluded.\n\nSomething like forcing each enemy to make a Wis or Cha save or be charmed into thinking every creature other than itself is an enemy could work just as well, be more balanced, and also more clear.\n\nIn any case, these are my own personal thoughts and you aren't required to listen to me in the first place.\n\nHope the feedback was help, cheers!",

But I still need to review the Planeshift Story.\n\n\\- **Stories of the Wanderer** would be better if it actually cast Find the Path or change to a Survival boost.\n\n\\- **Monster Stories:** Your wording is far more elegant and I will massage it into the new version. I adore the idea of negating the previous story when a new one pops up. Along with the 1/day limit it will improve the feel of almost all Ancient Stories.\n\n**\\*\\*For College of Dissonance\\*\\***\n\n**- Discordant Music:** For this feature, I was inspired by the Wizard: Order of Scribes that has a 2nd level ability of being able to change the spell's damage type, but I totally see your point.\n\nI will try to reduce the uses and remove the connection to Bardic Inspiration, but tie it to another stat, maybe Proficiency Bonus.\n\n**- Nightmarish Echoes:** From your points, I feel that this is an okay feature but needs better wording.\n\nI really like the workaround of \"reading thoughts\" without the Spell itself. It's more elegant this way.\n\n\\- **Shared Psychosis**, my bane, an idea I loved on paper but knew that it would be either too good or too bad and now that you pointed that out, I really need to make a massive overhaul on the effect. I like your idea even though I still want to explore something infused with more madness.\n\nOnce again, thank you so much for sharing your thoughts! It means a lot.",

            "selftext": "I've been reading the Malazan Book of the Fallen series this year and I love the idea of Karsa Orlong the barbarian confounding mages as the magic just melts before hitting him. I am trying to imagine how this would work as a 5e or OneDnd feat.\n\nThe problem with most magic resistance features in 5e today is they're just not the right flavor to match Karsa Orlong. But the flipside is you don't want to create something unbalanced.\n\nI was inspired by how the Ioun Stone of Resistance works:\n\n1. Any spell below 4th level is cancelled \n2. You have to use your reaction \n\nSo I'm taking a stab at a more volatile version of this feat that would create fun moments at the table. Looking for feedback on how it would play out and how to make it ludicrously fun without being too powerful \n\nI'm imagining this is either an origin feat or an epic boon. The scaling stuff would obviously only apply for the origin feat unless the boon was granted by a DM at an earlier level \n\nHere's the attempt:\n\n### Karsa Orlong Magic Resistance \n\nPrerequisite: no levels in a spellcasting class. If you gain levels in a spellcasting class you lose the effects of this feat (your DM may allow you to replace the feat). \n\nYou have consumed blood oil for many years, granting your body an innate magic resistance. Mages are astounded as magic simply melts on contact with your skin.\n\nWhenever you are subject to the effects of a spell, you may take a Reaction to roll 1d8. If the level of the spell is less than or equal to the number you rolled, the spell has no effect on you.\n\nAt 5th level you may roll 2d8 and take the higher number. In addition, the protection extends to anything you are wearing or carrying.\n\nAt 11th level you may roll 3d8 and take the highest number. In addition, the protection extends to within 5 feet of you.\n\nAt 17th level you may roll 4d8 and take the highest number. In addition, the protection extends to within 10 feet of you. If you have heroic inspiration, you may spend it to cancel the effects of the spell entirely.",

If they fail, the magic was able to penetrate his defenses.  My $.02\n\nAlso, things on your person use your magic save?\n\n  \nIf you don't like that, then I'd make this into a barbarian subclass.  Magic resistance, with counterspells built in with something like evasion making an appearance.  Maybe 0 damage with sucessful CON saves?",

This draft is still a work in progress, so I’d love any feedback, especially around balance and the tactical depth it brings. Thanks for checking it out, and I look forward to your feedback!\n\n  \nHere’s the PDF: [Echoblade 1.3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J7Aizqad7rqerA1NgeaKqhZI4CgM7U-6/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# Why the Echoblade?\n\nInspired by the Echo Knight, the Echoblade takes the concept of controlling echoes to a whole new level. This class is very tactical and flexible. It focuses on positioning and movement, using echoes to control the battlefield, create new attack angles, and outmaneuver opponents.\n\nThe Echoblade is for players who love tactics, setting up clever moves, and adapting on the fly. If you enjoy martial classes but want a deep tactical experience, this class is for you.\n\n# Core Class Features\n\n\\- Manifest Echo. The Echoblade’s core ability, allowing them to summon an echo—a spectral projection within 30 feet. This echo can serve as an alternate point for the Echoblade’s attacks and senses, make opportunity attacks, and even interact with objects. As the Echoblade advances, they can maintain multiple echoes, gaining first a second and later a third. At 20th level, one echo even becomes an independent creature with its own statblock.\n\n\\- Echo Points. A unique resource that powers the Echoblade’s special abilities. Echo Points are spent to activate advanced techniques, like extra attacks or rapid repositioning, enhancing the class’s flexibility and control.\n\n\\- Echo’s Grasp. An early ability that lets the Echoblade imbue their echo with shadow energy, creating an aura that slows and damages nearby enemies, increasing battlefield control.\n\n\\- Teleportation and Positioning. The Echoblade can swap places with their echo as a bonus action, allowing for quick, strategic repositioning. At higher levels, this ability extends to allies and enemies, further enhancing tactical options.",

I felt the Fighter archetype was thematically too limited to fully explore the tactical and flexible potential of echo manipulation, so the Echoblade aims to push those aspects further, creating a martial class that’s deeply focused on positioning, movement, and adaptive tactics.\n\nI haven’t had the chance to playtest it yet. Right now, I’m actually running a campaign where I’m playtesting another homebrew of mine, the Spellstrike, so I’m hoping to start testing the Echoblade later on. In the meantime, I’d love to refine it as much as possible with community feedback so it’s polished and balanced when I do bring it to the table. Any insights you have would be much appreciated!",

They're the initial core of the class and what makes it sing.\n* From there _sketch out_ how you want the class to interact with the other various breakpoint levels. (Level 7/9, 11, 13, 16).\n*  In particular, consider how 'new player friendly' you want this to be. This is not a friendly class to a new player.\n* Playtest playtest playtest.\n* Consider why you're tying features and points together. The Echo Grasp/Points feature at Level 2 really sticks out to me. It's an enormous amount of text to say \"Here's an emanation that isn't broken like spirit guardians, and you can use it twice-ish per rest because (all the reasons above).\" And then obviously they get points as well... (it's very monk like), but all the monk effects are _simple_. Hit twice. Run and Dash. And then the subclasses introduce other things.\n* Once you've got some feedback on power levels, really consider how you can consolidate words and make the language cleaner. How can you simplify mechanics so that you don't have to have a lot of extra case stuff? Consider the way you do rest. I'm not sure there's any other class out there that has such a complicated recovery mechanic. Is it necessary?\n\n\nFrom a power perspective:\n\n* The Level 3 Emanation is ridiculously strong, and it's basically unlimited. There's essentially never a reason to use this every single fight. It's a better version of Hunter's Mark. It's a better version of Multi Attack. It crowds in on Sneak Attack when it first shows up. It basically makes the Echoblade the king of AoE (especially when compared to the Wizard who has, what, sleep? Burning Hands?) at level 2. It's definitely _cool_, but it really crowds out other classes from a power perspective.",

This is my primary mechanical goal (along with universal goals like balance, etc.).

Anyway, I think the Echo Points are closer to Sorcery Points (or Spell Points) than to the Monk’s Ki Points.\n* You mentioned that the recovery system in this class is probably the most complicated. I’m not sure I understand that part. You regain a number of points equal to your proficiency bonus after each short rest, and all of your points after a long rest. Do you think this is more complicated than the recovery systems for the Wizard, Sorcerer, or Monk?\n* Regarding the Echo Grasp emanation, it’s actually a less powerful version of *Spirit Guardians*, but it’s true that it is available earlier than *Spirit Guardians* so this could be an issue. What do you think if it starts dealing damage at 5th level, like *Spirit Guardians*?",

                    "body": "Absolutely! I love discussing TTRPGs in depth, and I _love love_ discussing game design. Let's break it down:\n\n> So, the depth could be very high (close to Wizard level), but of course, it’d be even better if I can keep the depth high **while keeping the complexity low.**\n\nThis is a tough goal. The biggest thing you can do here is to make sure your class matches the base design of other classes. We'll return to this idea in terms of rest mechanics.\n\n> That said, this class isn’t really designed to be beginner-friendly.\n\nYeah, I figured. That's something to definitely point out in the notes for the class.\n\n> Each feature had its own uses. But **one user suggested I unify them somehow to reduce the class’s complexity while increasing its depth.** Could you explain your thoughts on this aspect in more detail? And if you have any suggestions, I’d love to hear them.\n\nSo, a couple things:\n\nFirst off, when you're soliciting feedback from people who aren't game designers, you should focus on the **problem** they've identified and not the solution. Because a player's solution will often be tailored for what would specifically work for them, and not from the perspective of making a better holistic design. Players don't think like Designers. That's not a problem, either! Their feedback that something was \"off\" is valuable. Your job as the designer is to turn that feedback into a design solution.\n\nSecondly: how we combine features determines how complexity and depth are affected.\n\nThird: the more features you combine into a resource system, the harder it will be to balance.\n\nYour initial design instincts made sense. This _should_ be its own feature. Look at your Level 20 feature. Transforming the Echo into Super Echo is a 1/rest thing.\n\nYour Echo Points right now do a lot of different things. They:\n\n- Make the emanation which is a core part of the class's kit\n- Allow extra echoes to be made, enhancing the kit\n- Flurry of blows (!!!)\n- Enable strange noodly advantage/disadvantage\n- Give Truesight (I actually like this one as an idea, though I'm not sure about the balance).\n- Gain HP\n- Better Dispel Magic (!!!) or limited Lesser Restoration (!!!) or limited Greater Restoration Abilities (!!!!!!!).\n- Create EVEN MORE MORE Echoes\n- The absurdly powerful lvl 17 Echo Shield (3 points to teleport and avoid damage or effects). Man, having unlimited counterspell sure seems nice.\n\nAnd this doesn't even get into how echo points interact with your subclass.\n\nI have no idea how you even begin to balance those options against each other. And given that they're all tied into the Echo Point system, the complexity of their decision making is going to get even more challenging:\n\nAt level 17, they've got 25 echo points. They'll know that in a given short rest, they would likely want:\n\n1. 3 Echo Points reserved per fight for the total number of echoes plus the emanation. (So maybe... 6? 9?)\n2. 2 Echo Points reserved for Dispel Magic/Lesser Restoration/Almost Greater Restoration\n3. Several buckets of 3 echo points available to ensure that you can avoid big nasty attacks (like a dragon's breath)... okay but then also consider about how you might want to spend extras...\n4. But wait maybe we need to spend points on extra attacks....\n\nThat's not _depth_. That's complexity masquerading as depth.\n\nThe problem with all these different effects is that they all do radically different things with no real cohesive unifier behind them.\n\nThe sorcerer's metamagic is easy: you modify spells. How each modification works varies, but at the end of the day, it's very easy to grasp \"modify spells\"\n\nThe monk's limited to up until Level 14:\n\n- Flurry of Blows (Extra Attacks)\n- Patient Defense (Movement or Defense)\n- Step of the Wind (Movement)\n- Stunning Strike (Stunning)\n- Class Features\n\nWhen you're using a point based system, you need to be cognizant of the total number of decisions players are going to have to make with those points.\n\nMonk to level 14 is relatively straightforward:\n\n- Punch more on this turn?\n- Stun more on this turn?\n- Do something tactical (move or defense)\n\nFor the Echo Blade, we have to think:\n\n- Spend 1 Focus point every fight, our damage is based on it.\n- Consider spending an extra focus point to manifest a second echo for maximum tactics\n- Consider spending an echo point to give an extra attack\n- Consider how many times we can spend focus points to take advantage of positioning with Deadly Mirage\n- Use TrueSight out of combat (which cool, but also... wow did you just say \"doors and traps are no longer an issue!\" ... which also, they really aren't at Level 13, but that's kind of the Rogue's deal?)\n- And... healing. But only when an Echo is destroyed. \n\nYeah, I can see the Christmas Land here: Create two echoes, give yourself advantage, stand in close, and hit an extra time.\n\nFour attacks at Level 11 (!!!!) all at advantage (!!!!) plus the ongoing AOE necrotic damage (!!!). All for.... 1, 2, 3, and possibly 4 echo points.\n\nIt's just a lot and there's not really a lot of thematic unity. It's complexity, which enables mastery, but that mastery isn't particularly nuanced. It's spend 2 Echo Points in setup and then 2 Echo Points every round to give yourself 4 attacks at advantage. (Also why wouldn't someone just multiclass to fighter at this point to get 8 attacks for 4 echo points...)\n\nIt's just a lot of complexity with not _that_ much depth. Four attacks at advantage every single turn for two points seems pretty good.\n\n> You mentioned that the recovery system in this class is probably the most complicated. \n\nIt absolutely is for the Monk and the Sorcerer.\n\nMonk:\n\n> When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.\n\nMonk, very simple: regain all expended points on a rest.\n\nSorcerer:\n\n> You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nSorcerer. Very simple: regain all expended points on a long rest. Now Sorcerer has the _optional_ feature of converting spells lots to sorcery points and back. But it's not a critical piece, and it also represents a point of mastery.\n\nThe sorcerer doesn't have to engage in this system unless they want to.\n\nWizard:\n\n> Level 1: Arcane Recovery. You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\n\nThis is far and away the most complicated feature for recovery, but Wizards are the most complicated class in the game. And, again, it's also a matter of Wizards being able to engage with the class when they want to--and they can only do it once per day.\n\nNow let's compare with yours:\n\n> Prof Mod on Short rest, all on Long rest.\n\nThe big problem with it is this: you're changing the modality of how many points are recovered based on the type of rest. It adds a burden to the player's mental stack: \"Okay, it's a short rest... is that proficiency mod, or all?\" \n\nIf I were designing this at a similar level of power, I would do something like:\n\n> When you spend an Echo Point, it is unavalable until you finish a Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.\n\nAnd then have some additional, separate feature:\n\n> **Focus Recovery**. On a short rest, you can regain a number of Echo Points equal to your Proficiency Modifier. (And then personally, I would just limit this to once per day.)\n\n___\n\n>  it’s actually a less powerful version of Spirit Guardians, but it’s true that it is available earlier than Spirit Guardians so this could be an issue. \n\nWell... and this is why I said don't worry about power right away. You need to focus on _if the class is fun_ with their kit as a whole. How does it feel running around the battlefield like a buzzsaw? Maybe the players really dig it! Maybe that'll tell you more about what you need the overall design to be.\n\nBut from a power perspective, let's look at this in the absolute worst case scenario: one enemy at level 2.\n\n* You've just outshone sneak attack (which doesn't do any damage if the rogue misses).\n* You've just outshone the monk who has to spend a focus point every time they want to get in an extra attack\n* You haven't outshone the paladin... but the paladin has to use spell slots to smite\n* You've outshone the fighter completely, who literally has nothing compared to this\n* You've outshone the barbarian who only gets +2 Rage Damage\n\nNow... start adding in two. Three. Four enemies in a _ten foot_ emanation... wow now you're completely blowing everyone away. Why even have other classes when the necrotic meat grinder can just turn on the buzz saw?\n\n___\n\nLook. This all probably comes across as super harsh, and I definitely don't mean it that way. And I'd absolutely encourage you to continue experimenting with this. But I also think this needs a solid pass - and the _very_ first thing to do is to playtest it at a few different level bands: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 to start.\n\nEnhancing the Echo Knight is _cool_. Having a better tactical fighter with increased mechanical depth is _cool_. These are great goals and you should keep iterating! But white room design will always show flaws when it hits the table.",

I know how much time and effort it takes to read, analyze, and comment on other people’s homebrew creations, especially classes. The level of detail and quality of your analysis is outstanding. So, I actually perceive you as the complete opposite, very generous.\n\n\n\n# PHILOSOPHY\n\nAs I mentioned before, from a mechanical perspective, the main goal of this class is to create a martial class with a deep and varied playstyle. As you rightly pointed out, it’s hard to increase depth without adding complexity, and in some areas, it’s impossible. So, I’m willing to accept a more complex class. I’d be happy to remove unnecessary complexity, though. Most classes have low depth, and they’re all martial classes, so that's why I want to create one that’s deep.\n\nThat said, there’s depth, and then there’s *depth*. In my view, depth in D&D is primarily introduced in one way: having many options to choose from. This is why casters tend to be the deepest classes.\n\nWith the Echoblade, I wanted to introduce/experiment with another type of depth: tactical positioning combined with its abilities. For the Echoblade, the core of tactical depth isn’t just in choosing an ability—it’s about creating and leveraging spatial relationships across the battlefield to make every move impactful. This kind of depth seems really interesting to me, as it’s more of an emergent depth, like in abstract strategy games such as Chess or Go.\n\nSpecifically, the Echoblade should implement this kind of emergent depth through the strategic use of the Echoes' positioning to: attack from various points, teleport itself, allies, and enemies, and slow down enemies.\n\nBut the level of depth achieved with these abilities still isn’t enough for me. If I could find more abilities that increase this kind of emergent depth, that would be perfect. As of now, I haven’t come up with any, but if you have suggestions in this area, I’d be absolutely thrilled to hear them. :-D\n\n# ECHO POINTS\n\nThis is where the Echo Points come in. Originally, they didn’t exist. But I created them to reduce the complexity of managing ability uses (having just one number instead of dozens). They also have the advantage of introducing a bit of the \"caster-like\" depth (i.e., \"having many options to choose from\"). Thanks to the Echo Points, I can introduce multiple options; without them, I couldn’t. I can offer many abilities because there’s a shared resource that limits how often they can be used. So, from my perspective, the benefits of Echo Points are:\n\n1. You only have to manage one number for the ability uses (reducing complexity).\n2. It allows for many abilities to be available (increasing depth).\n3. It introduces dilemmas on how to manage the resource (increasing depth).\n\nIf I understand correctly, you criticize Echo Points for these reasons:\n\na. They are resources managing too many unrelated abilities.  \nFrom my perspective, only *Shade of Reversion* might suffer from this criticism. The other abilities are generally tied to the magic of the Echo. So, I’d probably remove or replace that one ability, rather than removing the Echo Points entirely. But why would it be a problem to manage different abilities with a single resource? All casters do this, and they do it on a much greater scale.\n\nb. They are too complex without adding depth.  \nI don’t agree with either of these points. :-D  \nI don’t think it’s too complex, at least not more so than spellcasting. At 17th level, following your example, a Cleric has to choose 19 spells from a list of 100+ available spells. Then, during the day, they’ll have around 30 spells available (19 prepared + those granted by the subclass). There’s also a table that tells them how many spell slots they have for each level (four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level, etc.). On top of that, their options increase even more due to the ability to upcast spells. And there’s *Divine Intervention* at 10th level, which allows them to cast any 5th-level or lower spell (that’s not a reaction) from the Cleric list. The complexity level of a Cleric seems to be many orders of magnitude greater than that of the Echoblade. The same can be said for the Druid (spellcasting + Wild Shape), Sorcerer (spellcasting + Metamagic), and Wizard (the most complex class for many reasons).  \n I also don’t agree that it doesn’t add depth. The large number of options available and the dilemmas introduced by managing Echo Points create depth, because they create meaningful choices for the player.\n\n\\[Continue...\\]",

                    "body": "\\*\\*\\*PART 2\\*\\*\\*\n\n# RECOVERY SYSTEM\n\nLet’s set aside the balance issue for a moment and focus on the fact that you said it’s too complex. Let’s compare it to other classes:\n\n* **Cleric**. *Channel Divinity*: \"You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.\" Again, this has different logic for short and long rests.\n* **Bard**. *Bardic Inspiration*: \"You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\" But then at 5th level: \"\\[...\\]In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.\" Complexity introduced by converting between spell slots and Bardic Inspiration.\n* **Druid**. *Wild Shape*: \"You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Feature table.\" Like the Cleric. But at 5th level, there's an additional layer of complexity: \"Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required). In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, and you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\"\n* **Monk**. *Monk’s Focus*: \"When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.\" But then at 2nd level, it gets more complicated: \"When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.\"\n* **Sorcerer**. *Sorcery Points*: \"You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.\" But at 5th level: \"When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\" Plus, there are the conversion rules between points and slots.\n\nWe’ve already talked about the Wizard, so no need to repeat that. Given all of this, the Echoblade’s recovery system doesn’t seem that complex to me. :-D And anyway, as I’ve said, this isn’t a class for a typical new player. This is a class for players who enjoy managing a complex, deep character from a tactical/mechanical perspective.\n\n# BALANCE\n\nIn short: I agree with your analysis. :-D\n\nThe class needs to be nerfed in the first 5-10 levels. I was aware of this when I first presented the class here. The help I was looking for from the community was how and where to make these adjustments, and your analysis is perfect in this regard.\n\nA few extra comments:\n\n* **Eyes of Shade**. It essentially functions like the *True Seeing* spell. The difference is that *True Seeing* can be used by a caster (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) starting at 11th level; while the Echoblade can use it no earlier than 13th level.\n* **Deadly Mirage**. It’s definitely very strong and needs to be modified or removed. However, keep in mind that there’s a dilemma here. In general, the best strategy is to keep Echoes distant from each other and the Echoblade. To use *Deadly Mirage*, you’d have to go against this.\n* **Echo Shield**. It’s true that it’s a strong ability, but we’re talking about 17th level here. At this point, full casters have 9th-level spells (and also 8th, 7th, and 6th). And it’s not unlimited *Counterspell* as you said—it costs Echo Points. Keep in mind also the existence of *Temporal Shunt*, a 5th-level spell.",

                    "body": "> In my view, depth in D&D is primarily introduced in one way: having many options to choose from. This is why casters tend to be the deepest classes.\n\nYeah this is more or less accurate.\n\n> With the Echoblade, I wanted to introduce/experiment with another type of depth: tactical positioning combined with its abilities. For the Echoblade, the core of tactical depth isn’t just in choosing an ability—it’s about creating and leveraging spatial relationships across the battlefield to make every move impactful. This kind of depth seems really interesting to me, as it’s more of an emergent depth, like in abstract strategy games such as Chess or Go.\n\nRight, but as written, there's no tactical depth to the Echoblade because of the overwhelming strength of Echo's Grasp. They're no more complicated than the Barbarian or the Monk. An Echoblade:\n\n- Uses mobility to close in with the enemy and turn on the aura\n- Whacks at the enemy with any extra Echo Points powers (extra attacks, extra echoes, etc.)\n\n> Specifically, the Echoblade should implement this kind of emergent depth through the strategic use of the Echoes' positioning to: attack from various points, teleport itself, allies, and enemies, and slow down enemies.\n\nAgain, I'm not sure how much the positioning of the Echo Knight really matters. There's a very clear optimal strategy for the Echo Knight.\n\nSure if you're facing a spread out enemy, you get to bounce around with your echos and do swaps and that's kind of fun. But that's less depth than someone that actually has to spend resources to do that (like using Misty Step).\n\n> I can offer many abilities because there’s a shared resource that limits how often they can be used.\n\n> 1. You only have to manage one number for the ability uses (reducing complexity). \n\nThis doesn't reduce complexity. It *shifts* complexity.\n\n* At Level 7, a wizard can look down at their Character sheet and see that they have four spell slots available for fireball.\n* An Echoblade needs to look down at their character sheet and count out usages because the point values are all over the place. And because Echo's Grasp is the most important ability from an optimization standpoint, they always need to factor in. The math gets more complicated once you hit your Level 10 Breakpoint.\n\n> 2. It allows for many abilities to be available (increasing depth).\n\nThis doesn't actually increase depth unless the abilities are reasonably balanced and offer tradeoffs. Imagine if Wizards had a spell at 1st level that said \"Deal 100D6 damage automatically and cannot be saved.\" It doesn't matter how many other spells there are in the spell book, why would a Wizard ever use their spell slots for anything else? (Outside of utility.)\n\nWhat's more, much of the Echo Knight's kit has a lot of built in synergies, so it's not like there's choice here. It's just additional power.\n\nYeah, sure, there's stuff with Shadow Swap which might be neat, but I'm not sure how much better a teleport is going to be compared to slapping the enemy with 4D6 Necrotic Damage every round (on top of all the attacks).\n\n> 3. It introduces dilemmas on how to manage the resource (increasing depth).\n\nManaging resources is a form of depth... but again, there's not a lot of depth here:\n\n1. Turn on your Necrotic Damage\n2. Surround someone and attack them a bunch with extra echo points\n\n> The other abilities are generally tied to the magic of the Echo.\n\nIgnore flavor. It's more about how the abilities fit together with the same bucket of resources.\n\n> They are too complex without adding depth.\n\nRight. Echo Points don't add depth, and they just add and shift complexity.\n\nLook at how the Paladin is balanced and designed. They have a variety of discrete systems for different classes of abilities:\n\n- Lay on Hands\n- Channel Divinity\n- Spells & Smites\n\nLet's focus on Channel Divinity for the moment. Using Channel Divinity is a **big deal** for a paladin. The paladin needs to know that _this_ fight is the one that's going to require the big channel divinity ability, and the usage of it is important. That _choice_ is the depth you're looking for.\n\nThere's no choice in the Echo Knight.\n\nBut regardless, you missed my bigger issue with Echo Points, which I'm not sure I directly stated, and that's this:\n\n## Everything using Echo Points means they're much harder to balance\n\n_Divine Intervention_ is powerful, yes, but it's a very limited resource. The choice to use or not use DI is a big, interesting decision.\n\nLet's go back to your Cleric example. Imagine if Clerics used a Point system for their spellcasting. How would you cost Divine Intervention? 10 points? 20? The ability to cast any spell 5 and under is powerful.\n\n> I don’t think it’s too complex, at least not more so than spellcasting.\n\nRight, but the benefit is that spellcasting is a D&D system. The first time you play a spellcaster is going to be overwhelming. But the next time... you're just picking a different set of spells.\n\nSo... _why not just use spellcasting_? Why use all these strange echo points that are hard to balance?\n\nIf you want to mirror a class, mirror Paladins.",

                    "body": "> Let’s set aside the balance issue for a moment and focus on the fact that you said it’s too complex.\n\nYou're ignoring a very critical piece with your analysis:\n\nMost of the example's you list are for _discrete_ subsystems that are distinct from their core system.\n\n* Channel Divinity - a discrete subsystem, not for their core system (spells)\n* Bardic Inspiration - a discrete subsystem, not for their core system (spells)\n* Monk - we'll return to this\n* Wild Shape - a discrete subsystem, not for their core system (spells)\n* Sorcery Points - a discrete subsystem, not for their core system (spells)\n\nAnd these subsystems for the most part are very limited in usage.\n\n_And_ because they're limited and discrete they offer depth, reduce complexity, and add meaningful choice that doesn't paralyze players.\n\nYour echo point recovery is for everything. And _because_ it's for everything, the factor of \"how much do I spend because I've got a short rest coming up\" and \"should I use this special ability because I don't know if I have a fight\" becomes a bigger mental burden.\n\nNow let's return to Monk:\n\n- Once per long rest, regain all your focus points and heal.\n\nYeah... you're right. But:\n\n1. It's a one-time use that doesn't affect every rest.\n2. It has a very clear use case (I have no focus points. Okay, let's regain everything).\n\nIf your short rest mechanic matched the monk, I would have been perfectly happy with it.\n\n## Balance\n\n> The class needs to be nerfed in the first 5-10 levels.\n\nNo, the class doesn't need to be nerfed. You need to _figure out what the class is about_. If you want to have tactical positioning, then your class needs to reward tactical positioning.\n\nYou need to playtest your class. You need to stick it in the hands of a hardcore optimizer who's going to break the class in half by using it in the optimal way, because you're not seeing what I'm seeing.\n\n> In general, the best strategy is to keep Echoes distant from each other and the Echoblade. To use Deadly Mirage, you’d have to go against this.\n\nHow do you know this? From my reading, the best strategy for the Echo Knight is to turn on the razor blades and hit the enemy as many times as possible (as outlined above). \n\nWhat is the value of keeping Echoes apart from one another?\n\nIs it for battles where you have a bunch of weaker enemies spread across the battlefield? I mean, sure, that's great. But then you're not going to be using Deadly Mirage, which is very clearly for hitting big sacks of HP.\n\n> Eyes of Shade. It essentially functions like the True Seeing spell. The difference is that True Seeing can be used by a caster (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) starting at 11th level; while the Echoblade can use it no earlier than 13th level.\n\nYeah, I like Eyes of Shade. I think it's one of the best pieces of design in the whole class. But it shouldn't be tied to Echo Points.\n\n> And it’s not unlimited Counterspell as you said—it costs Echo Points.\n\nIt's effectively unlimited with 25 Echo Points and 6 that recharge on a rest. And it's better than Counterspell for defensive purposes:\n\n1. Someone casts Disintegrate\n2. The Counterspeller has to decide whether or not to counterspell before they see if the spell hits.\n3. The Counterspeller has to decide whether or not to burn a 6th-level spell slot to ensure the counterspell goes off.\n4. (2024), the spellslot stays for the original user.\n\nFor the Echoblade:\n\n1. You get hit with disintegrate.\n2. You decide that you don't want to deal with that and burn 3 Echo Points.\n\n> Keep in mind also the existence of Temporal Shunt, a 5th-level spell.\n\nYou should never ever ever compare your homebrew designs against splat book design. You should _always_ compare your designs against the base design of the system.\n\n## Last thoughts\n\nIf you're set on the design as is, that's fine.\n\nIt's certainly a _powerful_ class, and if power's what you're going for, then cool! You knocked it out of the park.\n\nBut if you're going for _tactical depth_, then I think you need to take a hard look at what it does. And you really, really, really need to playtest it.",

Protomagic, given the name, pre-dates the introduction of arcane magic to the world and such rituals can only be performed in areas of anti-magic. \n\nBecause of the rules surrounding the functionality of Protomagic, a Wizard who has devoted their life to understanding it has abilities which allow them to manipulate minor aspects of reality and spells, or potentially cast spells in situations where arcane power does not flow (anti-magic).\n\nAll feedback is welcome!

Also feedback is apreciated bc i want to use it again.  \n  \nChat GPT traduction:  \n  \n**Guardian Figurines**  \n*Wondrous Item (Requires Attunement by a Cleric or Paladin)*\n\nTwo stone figurines, one in the shape of an angel and the other a skeleton, each about 10 inches tall, rest within a stone box. A magical bond keeps the figurines from separating more than 15 feet from each other. Both figurines have gemstone eyes and are engraved with the symbols of the goddesses of Life and Death. The souls and egos of two great warriors are bound to these figures.\n\n**Summon Guardian:**  \nAs an action, you can place either or both figurines of Siarath and Verinfot on the ground and recite their names to summon them for one hour. They share your initiative and act immediately after you. The figurines can be summoned once per day. Siarath’s eyes regain their glow at dawn, and Verinfot’s at dusk. Once the time ends, the figurines automatically return to their master. If Siarath or Verinfot is defeated, they can be summoned again after 1d4 dawns or dusks, respectively.  \n*You must be attuned to the figurines for their eyes to regain their glow.*\n\n**Divine Command:**  \nAs a bonus action, you can telepathically command Siarath and/or Verinfot to act according to your will, provided the command aligns with their alignment. If not commanded, they act independently to protect their master’s life.\n\n**Magical Distance:**  \nIf at any point they are more than 1000 feet from their master, Siarath and Verinfot are instantly transported back to their master. If they cannot appear beside their master, they revert to figurine form.\n\n*Weight:* 30 lbs (15 lbs each)  \n*Proficiency Bonus:* \\+4\n\n# Siarath\n\n*Large Celestial, Chaotic Neutral*\n\n**Armor Class:** 18 (Studded Leather)  \n**Hit Points:** 100 (12d12 + 20)  \n**Speed:** 30 ft., fly 60 ft.\n\n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|12 (+1)|20 (+5)|14 (+2)|12 (+1)|18 (+3)|14 (+2)|\n\n**Saving Throws:** Strength +5, Dexterity +9, Wisdom +7  \n**Skills:** Medicine +7, Perception +10  \n**Damage Resistances:** Necrotic  \n**Damage Immunities:** Radiant, Poison  \n**Condition Immunities:** Blinded, Poisoned, Diseased  \n**Senses:** Blindsight 60 ft., Passive Perception 17  \n**Languages:** Celestial, Languages known by its master  \n**Challenge:** 10 (5,900 XP)\n\n**Magic Resistance:**  \nSiarath has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.\n\n**Multiattack:**  \nSiarath can make 2 attacks on its turn.\n\n**Actions**\n\n* **Radiant Bow:** Ranged Attack, +10 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) radiant damage.\n* **Evasive Reaction (Reaction):** When attacked, Siarath can move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.\n\n**Vital Echo (1/Day):**  \nSiarath and up to 3 creatures the celestial or you can see within 5 feet momentarily glow.

                    "body": "Honestly this seems kind of underpowered for an artifact tier weapon. Most artifacts are VERY late game items (level 15-20), and usually have a +3 enhancement bonus attached to them by default. Without the enhancement bonus this item isn't technically considered a magic weapon, which means that many end game creatures will be either resistant, or outright immune to the damage this weapon deals.\n\nThe idea for lasting bleed damage is good. But 1d6 without stacking, especially with the low DC it has, will not have any significant effect against the kinds of creatures you face at the level where you usually get artifact items. At best this effect causes the target to waste an action staunching the bleeding effect, which from an action economy perspective is helpful, it could be better. It should either have a higher damage rating, a higher DC, or the ability to stack bleeds to a certain degree. One of the three being boosted would be fine without making it too powerful of a feature.\n\nSimilarly the 1/encounter bonus 1d6 slashing damage is kinda weak. Very few items scale their resources by encounter because of how inconsistent that metric is, especially since most DMs generally only run 1-2 encounters per day for balancing reasons. If you're gonna keep it a lower damage dice, you could buff that to be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per short or long rest, to get some significant use out of it.\n\nPersonally I don't think the advantage on stealth checks needs changing. It's not a spectacular ability for a heavy weapon to have, but it's not troublesome enough to get rid of as well. Most classes that heavily rely on stealth won't use this without a highly specialized build, and the martials that will use it will either have low stealth or disadvantage from armor.",

                    "body": "Hello there!\n\nI see some duellist/swashbuckler theme in this subclass, with its speed-based fighting. There are a couple of issues with it, though.\n\n***Fast Movement & Surprise Tactics***\n\nBoth of these are okay, no issue I can see here.\n\n***Skirmisher***\n\nWhile the move-on-reaction part is fine, is the other half supposed to be easily exploited by moving 5ft back and forth? With *Cunning Action* for BA Disengage, it's not hard to move 30ft back and forth and then get advantage on the attack roll (thus, *Sneak Attack* sneaks in).\n\nDid you mean you had to move 30ft in a line, like the *Charger* Feat asks for 20ft of straight line movement?\n\n***Superior Mobility***\n\nWay too overpowered. It essentially gives you the bonus of Dodge, Dash *and* Disengage, all in one *Cunning Action* BA.\n\nYou would literally never stop Dashing for this sort of bonus, even if you never go anywhere and stand perfectly still. It's a free +4 to AC as a BA, at will, which rises to +5 at 13th and +6 at 17th.\n\nOn top of advantage on Initiative rolls, too.\n\nYou can keep the Initiative advantage, but for the other, I would remove the bonus to AC entirely. Taking Dash and Disengage in one go is powerful enough as it is.\n\n***Sonic Strikes***\n\nThis damage can rack up insanely quickly. At 13th level as a Human, you have base speed 30ft + 25ft from *Fast Movement*, meaning 55ft base walking speed. With BA Dash that's 110ft, meaning you can buzz 5ft back and forth and get +10d4 thunder damage to your attack, free of resources.\n\nAt this point, your *Sneak Attack* is 7d6. The average is 24.5 against the 10d4's average of 25, meaning this *Sonic Strikes* is essentially like your *Sneak Attack*, except you have to move instead of needing advantage or an ally near the enemy.\n\nLet's not get into the *Haste* buff, either.\n\nIf it were for each 10ft you moved in a straight line, it would be much better, since you'd need to actually move around a lot more.\n\n***Blinding Speed***\n\nI am against feature stealing, and this is the Thief subclass's capstone. Taking it and placing it here feels cheap. Especially since the Thief isn't a combat-specialised subclass while this one is, meaning it gets more benefit out of it than the original feature intended.\n\nWhy not give a flavour ability? The ability to cast *Time Stop* once per long rest, as you move so fast everything feels like it's in slow motion. You can't attack as per the spell's normal description, but you can move willing creatures, so you can use the time stop to rearrange your teammates in an instant, or buff yourself with *Haste*.\n\nOr maybe an ability that replicates *Steel Wind Strike* \\- choosing targets and making them roll a save or take damage as if you had rushed past them at blinding speed.\n\n***Overall***\n\nAside from those few issues, the subclass works. Makes use of the Rogue's base abilities and all.\n\nHope the feedback helped, cheers!",

For me its overpowered as hell. Its a middle finger to the arcane trickser.\nOf cause the spells choice of the whirlwind is more limit which is no problem, since they fit so perfectly anyway. Who cares for other spells when you already get the best spells for you class. Also the whirlwind class get his level 2 and 3 spells at level 6 and 9 while the arcane trickser have to wait until level 7 and 13. So 1 and 4 levels later. 4!!! The whirlwind can use until them 6 limited spells. The arcane trickser has to use spellslots each time. If we compare the whirlwind with the level 13 arcane trickser, where he get his level 3 spellslots and both use each 6 spells (2x1,2x2,2x3) the arcane trickser just end the day with only 2 level 1 spellslots and 1 level 2 spellslots more. Kinda unfair that thw whirlwind get so many spells for free.\nBut this is not enough with haste the whirlwind gets rediculous strong.\nDouble movement speed, +2 AC, adv dex ssving throw and a second action for yes a second attack or even more damage from more walking sice you can use dash aswell.\n\nI really like fast character aswell but and here this class should get as much movement as possible but now it comes, for me this isnt actually a \"fast rogue\". I try to explain what i mean.\nIt doesnt fit the theme what i think about rogue personally. I want to attack fast, precise, that nobody see what i actually do. The playstyle here is the opposite.\n Skirmisher gives me adv on attacks after i walk 30 feet. This rogue can walk more distance than other character at the same time but i dont actually want to attack fast, i want to walk as much as possible before i attack. So in my mind i stay close range in front of an enemy. I dont run to him and attack him. I rather run 3 circle around him before i actually attack. Of cause each round is around 6 seconds but for me the first example the rogue would attack faster.\nI hope you understand what i mean and im not to hard to you OP. \n Skirmisher gives adv under 30 feet distance makes actually more sense to me. But i understamd that this is complete against the class kit \n\n\nHere a feature what would i got in my mind what would fit a fast rogue.\nYou are so fast that your enemies got no time to react to your actions\nIf you are not more than half your basic speed away from an enemy they can't take a reaction until the end of you turn. This way you can even walk to them,attack and run away without a opportunity attack.",

                    "body": "Sounds like you are using the retcons from that heretical Fizban's book. There is no such thing as the 'First World'. Or rather, there is, and it is called Greyhawk, and has long-established lore of its own which is not for WotC to bulldoze over with its unspired vaguenesses. \n\nIo is the creator of the multiverse, the prime material plane of Greyhawk, magic, and all of dragonkind. Not Tiamat, and not Bahamut. In some versions of the story, Tiamat and Bahamut are Io's children, in others they are his creations, and in another they are the divine halves of his shattered self after his death. In all instances, they hate each other, and always have. Io created everything there was out of love for his dragons, and these ceaseless attempts at retconning him out of his own creation myth sits very poorly with me. On that note, what you describe as 'Dragonsdawn' would be a celebration that is squarely aligned with Io - not Tiamat, whose flawed nature does not have the capacity for such nuance. I don't recognize where you have this one from; I'd be curious to know the source on that, if it is not invented. \n\nWhat Tiamat does have going for her is the firm belief that she is the rightful inheritor of the prime material plane. As the prime material was made for dragonkind, and she sees herself as the first among dragons, she thinks it hers - and she has a point, because the prime *is* the rightful realm of dragons, and her virtue lies in being willing to fight viciously for that right, while Bahamut willingly abandons it to the humanoids. But since dragons don't generally bother worshipping either of them - and those who do tend to end up dead as a result of their civil war - and this ownership of the prime material is not a popular talking point among the humanoid cultists who worship Tiamat, it is a point that ends up rather forgotten.",

As worded, it can reasonably be read that the cantrips you “choose” in the first point are the ones in the second. It never says you learn or gain the first three, is that the new standard? Forgive me if I’m not up-to-date.\n\nOtherwise, I would recommend you refer to the abilities in the second point as something other than cantrips. They are certainly parallel to cantrips, but they aren’t really on any spell lists, so the wording feels disconnected to me, and can affect clarity (like in my last paragraph). Another example, Magical Secrets allows a Bard to learn two spells from a class, as worded it’s unclear if these might be options yknow? You say spell list and use class names, it borders.\n\nBig fan of what you’re doing here though, super fun concept! I’m always here for more interesting low level experiences. I might suggest a d6 to make it a little more varied over the course of a longer game. Some extra stuff that isn’t competitive power wise, but adds flavour and can become signature for a character. A lit flame that follows you until you use the feature again and changes color based on your mood, that sorta thing. I think the present options already do a great job at covering consistently useful low level utility. Because the BA is limited, I might even suggest having the healing scale, just a little. The other two options stay useful forever, skill bonus and auto damage are great.",

                    "body": "Hi there fellow wild magician! Thanks for your input, I think I can show off a variant of this feat you might be interested in. But first, I feel compelled to point out a few nuances. This feat is a 2024 Origin Feat, and so I wanted to design a Feat that would be taken by a player (possibly even a brand new player) at level 1. This means using Magic Initiate, Alert, Tavern Brawler, etc as guidance for power level. \n\nMagic Initiate in particular was used as a template. That feat grants a cantrip and a 1st-level spell from one of three spell lists. This feat lets you choose 3 cantrips, learning one from each of the three lists, however you can only cast one at a time unless you use a Bonus Action to randomly cycle through. This Bonus Action is where a little bit of the power level and wild nature comes through. You produce a magical effect (notably not a spell, so it's not subject to Counterspell) which are mini-versions of Bless, Goodberry, and Magic Missile that don't require and saving throws or concentration. Because you can use this multiple times a day and it scales with your Proficiency Bonus, I think these effects adequately cover the power level of the free 1st level spell. Especially as a bonus action and a 50% chance of producing the effect that you want.\n\nSince this is an Origin Feat and not a subclass feature, I wanted to strike a balance with flavor. This feat is simply dipping-your-toes in wild magic so to speak, with your wild magic subclass pulling most of the weight.\n\nAll that is to say, if you want some more power and more wild magic flavor, try this feat:   \n\n# Wild Magic Adept\n## General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)\n*You gain the following benefits.*  \n\n**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n\n**Chaotic Cantrip.** You learn one cantrip of your choice from each of the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists. The ability score you increased is your spellcasting ability for this feat’s spells.\n\nWhen you cast one of these cantrips you can roll a d8 to determine a wild magic effect:  \n1. You immediately use your Reaction to cast the cantrip again  \n2. You cast the *Healing Word* spell.  \n3. You cast the *Entangled* spell.  \n4. You cast the *Witch Bolt* spell.  \n5. Non-magical vegetation within 5 feet of you wither and die.  \n6. For the next hour, you can only speak in a random language you don't know.  \n7. You are encased in an eggshell. You are Restrained by the shell and can use your Actions to make a Strength check (DC 15). If it succeeds, you are no longer Restrained.  \n8. You are Incapacitated until the end of your next turn. \n\nIf the effect is a spell that normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. Once you roll a d8 this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.",

The cantrips \"chosen\" in Chaotic Cantrip are not the Wild Magic Effects in Roulette Role.\n\nI used the words \"choose\" and \"learn\" here to try and describe different states. The design intent is that when you take this feat, you *permanently* pick one cantrip from each spell list but you would only be able to cast it while you've *temporarily* \"learn\" the cantrip by rolling the d4.\n\nFor example, you choose: \n* Guidance from the Cleric spell list \n* Starry Wisp from the Druid spell list\n* Minor Illusion from the Wizard spell list\n\nWhen you use your Bonus Action for a use of Roulette Role and roll a 1 you can cast Guidance but not Starry Wisp or Minor Illusion until you Roulette Role again. If you roll a 4, on the d4 you benefit from the  *Wildcard* Roulette Role which lets you choose one from any of the three Chaotic Cantrips until you Roulette Role again.\n\nIf I understand your comment about the Roulette Role abilities, there may be confusion about the Wild Magic effects that is produced instantaneously. That Wild Magic effect is not the cantrip, no that is not my intent. The class that is stated just refers to which of the three Chaotic Cantrips you can cast at will for the time being and a thematic magic effect.\n\nPerhaps I could reword Roulette Role as:\n> \"**Roulette Role.** As a Bonus Action, roll a d4 to determine a spell list. The spell list determines which Chaotic Cantrip you have learned until the next time you use this Bonus Action. The spell list also determines a Wild Magic effect that is produced instantaneously:\"\n\nThe fourth option can be more clarified as:\n> \"**Wildcard.** You choose which of the three Chaotic Cantrips you learn and which of the three Wild Magic effect you produce.\"\n\nI hope that clarifies that these Wild Magic effects are neither new cantrips, spells, or the Chaotic Cantrips in the first part.\n\nUsing the chosen cantrips from my earlier example, your turn might look like this:\n\n>Bonus Action. You Roulette Role and roll a 2. You learn the Starry Wisp spell and \"forget\" the other two Chaotic Cantrips. You also create three magic berries.\n\n>Action. You can now cast Starry Wisp, eat a berry, or whatever you like.\n\nOn a subsequent turn, regardless of how much time has passed, even after a Long Rest:\n\n>Bonus Action. You Roulette Role and roll a 4. You choose to forget Starry Wisp and learn Guidance. You also choose to produce the \"Wizard\" Wild Magic Effect and create magic dart dealing 1d4+1 force damage.\n\n>Action. You cast the magic missile spell.",

We really wanted the book to scream HALLOWEEN, and making ONLY undead is kinda boring. SO! This monster is part of three monstrosities created by fusing souls together. Creations of the dreaded powers of Animancy, the same magic that animates the dead! About the Nuckelavee in particular…\n\n_\"The Nuckelavee is another abomination created by Animancy, a nightmarish fusion of fey and horse twisted by malevolent, abyssal forces. A spirit of slaughter, breaking the laws of reality with its very presence. As with many other beings in this category, the creator of such a heinous monster is unknown, yet one thing is for certain; the ritual that bound the fey to such a fate took place in the sea. Nuckelavees are bound to bodies of salt water, yet paradoxically, have great trouble with rivers and running water. This has led many to believe that their inception has something to do with vampires, much like the Aswang.\"_\n\nThe Nuckelavee has a bunch of different D&D adaptations. This is our take! We made it a fey/undead monster, and of course, we tied it with the lore of our world…\n\nWe did a bunch of creatures based on folklore. Monstrosities, werewolves, undead, vampires, variant liches and death knigths… just a bunch of cool stuff. Perfect for your Curse of Strahd game :3\n\n[**More previews on our subreddit! Come over, we've been growing it a lot :3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/codexofstrings)\n\nCheers and Happy Threadseeking!",

                    "body": "The Pact of the Aegis gives you an empowered and eldritch shield, a gift from your patron to suit a warlock who wades into the fray and stands on the front line.\n\n[GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-OAUUH7DqunjWNyGOho8) | [PDF](https://www.somanyrobots.com/s/Warlock-Pact-of-the-Aegis.pdf)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/6p6DqCxTTw) | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/somanyrobots)\n\nThe Pact of the Aegis grants a warlock a powerful defensive boon, a pact shield which they can use for defense, offense, and maybe even for spellcasting too. The basic invocation gives you a pact shield, which you can use as a normal shield and as a melee weapon. It gives you Extra Attack once you hit level 5, rather than forcing you to pay an invocation tax for it. And it gives you heavy armor proficiency, unique among warlocks. And it comes with a set of new invocations! **Ally's Aegis** is a straightforward defensive boon, enhancing the armor and saves of everyone around you. **Eldritch Bash** turns your shield into a spellcasting focus and lets you apply cantrip riders on your attacks — finally a good reason to care about a cantrip that's not Eldritch Blast (though, for good measure, it does work with EB's push invocation). **Empowered Bash** is for warlocks who can't live without using Charisma for attack and damage; you don't have to pay a subclass tax, but it's still gonna cost you an invocation. **Whirling Aegis** lets you hurl your shield as a ranged weapon, even ricocheting it around your enemies like ~~Steve Rogers~~ a pinball wizard. And **Reflected Agony** lets you slam enemies as payback for their attacks, giving you an unreliable third attack.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, the Pact of the Aegis is also fully compatible with the Omega Warlock, by u/swEcky! It's a warlock revision that has been the standard at my table and many others for years, which rebalances the pacts and elevates them into full subclasses (for a dual-subclass design). The Omega version of the Pact of the Aegis is similar, but with some key differences and reworks to better suit the situation. **Eldritch Aegis** provides the pact's base features, with **Eldritch Bash** and **Ally's Aegis** unchanged. **Extra Bash** at 5th is just our version of Extra Attack. **Ricochet Attack** is reworked slightly, with its bonus damage rescaled and moved into its own feature, **Empowered Bash** — this provides some added damage scaling into tier 3. And **Mighty Bulwark** at level 18 is totally new, giving you a brutally effective tool for defending yourself and allies.\n\nThis is already a _very_ wordy comment, but one last note: the Pact of the Blade is a bit of an elephant in the room, and the Pact of the Aegis can be read, a bit, as an upgrade over it. Aegis isn't meant to replace Blade, but it _is_ aiming to produce a melee warlock pact that avoids Blade's major flaws — the brutal invocation taxes, mainly, and the need to pick Hexblade as your subclass in order to get the basic proficiencies you need to function. (As well as that sweet Charisma for attacks — I personally don't love it, but I know many warlock enjoyers consider it essential.)\n\nAs always, you're invited to come discuss and offer feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6p6DqCxTTw)!",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! a couple of months ago I had a surge of inspiration and made a couple of Olympian Gods inspired subclass. I was hoping for any thoughts or feedback on this, please let me know what you think about the flavor and the balance. \n\n  \nThe inspiration for this subclass was Hermes, in modern media he is often represented as a speedster so I took a lot of inspiration from that, and then some psychopomp element for Talk with Dead, and trickster element for the persuasion and deception proficiency.\n\nInitially, Burst of Agility was simply a copy of the tabaxi feature that allows the character to double their speed to give anyone who used this subclass the option to not have to play a tabaxi, but I opten to change it somewhat.\n\n# Level 3: Charging Strike\n\nYour momentum empowers your strikes. For each 20 feet you move in a straight line immediately before making a melee weapon attacking or an unarmed strike, you can choose one of the following effects. A creature can only be affected by each of these effects once per turn:\n\n·        You have Advantage on the attack roll.\n\n·        You add one roll of your Martial Art’s die to the attack’s damage roll.\n\n·        If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from yourself.\n\n·        If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n# Level 3: Burst of Agility\n\nYour reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed, granting you the following benefits:\n\n**Initiative.** When you roll Initiative, you can add your (Wisdom modifier/proficiency bonus) to the roll.\n\n**Quick Start.**  At the start of the first turn of each combat and after each turn you moved 0 feet double your speed until the end of turn. Alternatively, you can double your speed until the end of the turn by gaining one level of exhaustion.\n\n# Level 6: Unstoppable Force\n\nYour speed allows you to power through obstacles. You gain the following benefits:\n\n**Run Through.** When you take the Dash action, you can use 2 Focus Points to move through spaces occupied by other creatures. Each creature whose space you pass through must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die, or half as much on a success. A creature can only take this damage once per turn.\n\n**Swift Pummel.** When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make an additional Unarmed Strike as part of the same bonus action.\n\n# Level 6: Far Travelled\n\nYou can spend 2 Focus Points to cast the *Speak with Dead* or the *Tongues* spell without any spell components.\n\nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills, if you are already proficient you gain expertise instead.\n\n# Level 11: Fast Travel\n\nYou have learned to travel great distances in an instant. You can spend 10 Focus Points to cast the *Teleport* or the *Plane Shift* spell without any spell components. When you do so, you gain a level of exhaustion for each additional creature you bring with you.\n\n# Level 17: Divine Speed\n\nYour mastery of speed allows you to react with unparalleled quickness. You can take one reaction on every creature’s turn, rather than only one reaction per round.",

                    "body": "Alright, so, most of this is fairly standard in terms of power-level, but there are a couple of outliners, both in terms of too strong and too weak.\n\nLet's go in order.\n\n***Charging Strike***\n\nThis idea isn't bad. The wording prevents you from shifting 5ft several times in front of an enemy for the bonus, so you're forced to at least move 20ft in a straight line, kind of like the *Charger* Feat.\n\nDo specify that the saving throws use your Ki save DC, though. It sounds obvious, but you should still specify it.\n\n***Burst of Agility***\n\nAdding your Wisdom modifier to your Initiative rolls is fair enough. Don't add your PB as well.\n\nFor *Quick Start*, I'd only double your move speed during the first round of combat. It's enough in conjunction with the rest.\n\n***Far Travelled***\n\nNo issues at all.\n\n***Unstoppable Force***\n\n*Swift Pummel* is fine. Strong, but not excessively so. However, *Rush Through* definitely is.\n\nForce damage is good, but beyond that, you already have speed boosts from the Monk base class and taking the Dash action. With *Step of the Wind* costing 1 Ki point for the Disengage as BA and this costing 2 Ki points, this means that with an action and a BA and 3 Ki points your 60ft+ speed can carry you through a dozen creatures by zigzagging into their spaces, each of them taking 3 MA dice (or half on a save, guaranteeing some damage), all the while the Disengage prevents opportunity attacks.\n\nThis is strictly better than using Attack action + *Flurry of Blows* when against more than two enemies.\n\nEspecially since it's not the only 6th-level feature you get.\n\nIf instead of automatic damage this feature allowed you to make a single attack roll against each creature whose space you move through, dealing normal damage on a hit, it would be better. Less damage and it requires a roll, but you can make many more attacks and it still works well with the Disengage.\n\n***Fast Travel***\n\nAlright, so *Plane Shift* and *Teleport* are both 7th-level spells. Meaning a fullcaster gets them at 13th-level *minimum*, two full levels after this feature.\n\nI would switch *Divine Speed* to 11th-level and lower it to having a number of reactions per turn equal to half your Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) for a maximum of 3 (and specifying you can only use 1 reaction per triggering effect), and then move *Fast Travel* to 17th level.\n\nIf you do move it to 17th level, I would also remove the levels of exhaustion - those spells are good, but not so good you'd take 4-5 levels of exhaustion just to bring your party along.\n\n***Divine Speed***\n\nAlready talked about it above.\n\n***Overall***\n\nThe idea is cool, the abilities are cool, it really just needs a couple of touch-ups. Hope the feedback was helpful, and cheers!",

                    "body": "It's an interesting class, though i think is strong in places but generally just too weak.\n\nIt's fine for multiclassing. The resourceless 1st level Sway feature is pretty tempting as a free bonus action, but few other classes are going to qualify for it. Because it relies on both Cha and Int (both common dump stats in many builds), it won't be a common dip. I've been thinking how i would best optimise a multiclass with this and the best i can come up with is some sort of Bladesinger/Paladin or Bladesinger/Warlock combination, but that's pretty niche.\n\nPlaces where the class is weak: It gets bad saving throw proficiencies. It's very MAD - it needs high CHA, INT, CON (for hit points) and DEX (for armor). It hasn't got much in way of defences. It's main feature - Sway - is limited by being a single shot feature (there's only one chance of it working and then you can't use it again for 24 hours). Plus, most enemies will have advantage on their save because you're fighting them.\n\nAnd maybe the biggest drawback is that at high levels, enemies with immunity to charmed become very common, and then suddenly the Socialite is missing half their class and feeling pretty useless.\n\nDamage-wise, Learning Curve does add up to a pretty good DPS... if they can actually ramp up. Yet most combats are over in 3-4 rounds however, and they're rarely all against single target, so Learning Curve is pretty poor.\n\nThe subclasses are equally subjective. The Schemer's 6th level feature is pretty useless because you'd never want to risk a creature succeeding and then losing Sway condition. The Negotiator is built around certain creature types which was bad for the original Ranger and is bad here. The Peacock and the Knight are pretty decent, with the Knight seems to be best.\n\nYet in very specific encounters - when you're facing a boss monster with vulnerability to charm and a lot of HP, for instance - where the Socialite could absolutely dominate. It's just those ideal encounters are rare.",

The first one felt a bit convoluted so I tried to simplify it a lot.\n\nThe class is mainly build around the \"swayed\" condition. It's supposed to play like a debuffer that also deals single-target damage.\n\nProbably the most controversial things are gonna be the \"swayed\" condition - which might deserve a nerf to \"substract \\*half\\* your charisma modifier (rounded up)\" (then again Charisma won't be the main stat of the class probably) and the fact that I allow the class to use Int for their weapons which makes this a very powerful dip for multiclassing. Perhaps I'd have to find some restrictions there or I'll just let them use Str/Dex like everbody else. We'll see.\n\nOh and the Learning Curve feature aswell of course. That might be a bit too strong, idk. The class doesn't get Extra Attack to compensate for that.\n\nAnyway... what do you think?\n\nHomebrewery-Link:\n\n[https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/UhlTMSikXEX5](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/UhlTMSikXEX5)",

I did consider giving the class Int instead of Str/Dex when determining the AC as I did with the Peacock subclass - but then I figured that'd be to powerful. This would solve the MAD problem a bit. \n\nSway probably shouldn't be that limited, I agree. One should get the chance to retry again.  Perhaps at a certain level the class could just get the feature \"creatures that are immune to the charmed condition aren't immune to becoming swayed by you\"... \n\nI'll also try to find a way to ramp up the DPS of Learning Curve. \n\nThanks for your feedback.",

                    "body": "So I am back and I agree mostly with highdigestboots but I disagree with learning curve. It's not weak. It is superweak. I did some math against a fighter with both the same d6 and d8 weapons and modifier of +3/+4 no fighting styles, feats and 100% hitchance.\nAt round 3 and 4 you deal more damage then the fighter but the start is so bad that you have to wait until round 6/7 with +3/+4 mod and d6 weapondamage or 5/6 with mod +3/+4 and d8 weapon damage to actually outdamage the fighter.\nThe numbers get worse when the fighter actually picks a martial weapon with higher dices to fight and not a simple weapon.\nAnd don't forget that your class lose dices if it one time miss a enemy.\n\nFunny thing is when I read learning curve I had actually your level 7 Feature in mind, before I read it. \n\nSo learning curve is pretty weak but then again on the other side you have op features.\nPersonal fame and fortune is strong but it really gets redicioul with shing stars since both got no limit. I would spam healing word on this character even with full hp to give the complete team temporary hp. You are right this class need defensive tools but not like this. I would also increase the hit dice to d10. \n\nTaking advantage is really strong but fine I think. I like the mini game. The longer you wait, the better the crit gets but also the enemy will mostly lose already enough hp, that the crit isn't too hurtful.\n\nI wonder why the class has access to all fighting styles cause I think a few don't fit, but this is just a small detail.\n\nA other thing about sway which makes me wonder. The worse the int of the enemy the better the chance to sway it. But I actually think this is wrong. For example a giant rat has int 2. I don't think a giant rat will actually care about the (in your words) promises and social status, since it doesn't actually understand what this is.\nSo I would add that the enemy has to share the same language you speak. I don't know how much of a nerf this would be\n\nSteeles mind is fine the way it is. Immunity and resistance in one feature but since it is psychic damage, it's fine.\n\n\nI had enough work with the math I did so I didn't read anything about the subclasses, but I already said enough. I think they will be around Cha as a core mechanic since the basic class is about int. This will be a problem since your class needs so many attributes.\n\nThere is a lot of work to do but it can be an interesting class  :)",

                    "body": "Yeah - I'd be careful because though class does need a buff, a lot of the obvious fixes could easily make it too powerful. And there are parts of it which are already really strong (like all the temp hp it throws out constantly or the extra damage it gives the party).\n\n\nPersonally I think Sway should have some sort of resource attached to it. Maybe make it so you can use it multiple times again on a creature, but you have a limited number of uses like Bardic Inspiration that recover per rest. Otherwise it could get a bit wild if you can just constantly throwing out Sways at everyone until they eventually fail.\n\n\nI also might be tempted to say that you can only have one creature Swayed at a time, and then remove that enemies have advantage on the save if you're fighting it.\n\n\nFor flavor, you could also say it's an Intelligence save if you're targeting a humanoid (i.e a creature you're manipulating with convincing words) or a Wisdom save if targeting a beast (i.e a creature you're manipulating more instinctively) - just to help with the feel of how Socialites can manage to somehow persuade things that can't even understand them.\n\n\nLearning Curve is a tricky one because I do like the gameplay element of it, it just doesn't work with most combats. Maybe give alternate ways to ramp up the number of dice; say maybe once per turn you can also add a dice if creature the misses you with an attack roll, or if you succeed a saving throw against it. And if it's swayed, you can automatically roll an extra damage dice against it.\n\n\nAlso, as a bit of a nitpick, currently Learning Curve strongly encourages you to use heavy weapons. Because it's based on weapons dice size, right now the optimal weapon for a Socialite is a greataxe with a 1d12 damage die... but the idea of a Socialite with a giant axe doesn't really mesh thematically...",

Why does opposites give bonuses?, who wants to bite into something and have it be both dry and wet, or both soft and hard, I feel like that would give me a panic attack\n\nSubclasses\n\n- culinary science is really vague, needs more clarification \n- arcane vivarium is way to strong, getting a +1 item for free is just a little absurd, though I do like it being a portable garden\n- molecular gastronomy is similarly confusing, how long does it take to make the candy?, do they take up storage space?, do you still spend material components?\n- the crs on nouvelle cuisine seem way to high to be consistently useful, which for a capstone doesn't feel good when you get to use it once in a blue moon \n- also, why does this subclass not get prof in cooks tools?, fills weirdly missing\n\nMagic item meals\n\n- the crafting times feel a little ridiculous, like why does it take a third of a year to make a meal, especially when one of the examples listed is a cocktail, I feel like after rare the crafting time becomes unreasonable to ever effectively use unless a dm goes out of their to make sure the party can do so\n- the actual meals are cool, and I love the flavor (heh) of them\n\nI should probably go through this more indepth, but I think you get the point, it's got phenomenal bones, but needs to be made less vague/more specific, define more things and such\n\n\nEdit: 7",

                    "body": "Hello, thanks for the comments and questions! I'll try to explain my thought process for each of your points, and maybe you can confirm if things are clarified or if the wording is still confusing, and I can figure out how to make them clearer in the document.\n\n* Strength characters can eat just the same as any other party member - ie, as much as they want, due to the provision die mechanic. In-fiction, they're bigger people, so they have to eat more. Mechanically, the provision die interacts with this such that you don't have to worry where your next meal is coming from. We can assume that the Strength-based characters are pulling their weight in terms of carrying supplies, foraging, hunting, etc.\n\n* Being poisoned multiplies your appetite with the square root of negative 1, meaning your appetite is imaginary and \"does not exist\". Maybe a bit out of left field to pull an imaginary number like that. The alternative to this was to use -1, to show you have a negative appetite. In either case, it means you cannot eat anything, and you will go hungry despite the availability of food.\n\n* Thanks!\n\n* The flavor profile thing essentially rests on the fantasy that you're such a good cook, you can make weird things work. And because the food is weird, but it's good/it works, the diner goes through a culinary experience they've never gone through before. But, an example of a simultaneously dry and wet meal would be bran cereal - the bran is dry, the milk is wet. A single bite contains both dry and wet elements. Also, a smore is simultaneously soft and hard. The cracker is hard, the marshmallow is soft.\n\n---\n\n* True. I left the interpretation pretty open. The idea is this feature is active whenever the PC makes meals, whether that's during a short rest, a long rest, or as part of an active adventuring day. They can incorporate monster parts into their meals, and depending on the type of creature they throw in there, the diner gains a benefit. This meal stacks with other food-related effects such as the Chef feat, and can even be a Masterwork Meal.\n\n* I can definitely remove the +1 bonus to that. I just figured that since this subclass has no subclass spells, it's behind all the other subclasses in combat, and none of its other features are usable in combat, either. Perhaps making it a +1 at a much later level will ease the curve here.\n\n* Molecular gastronomy only says you can make one per long rest. The intention, at least, is that the other details are irrelevant, as the feature allows you to just produce them during a long rest (time taken, materials required, are abstracted away over those 8 hours, as they don't come into play meaningully). I notice a typo there as I read over that section, my bad. Also, the feature says it's a bite-sized candy, so it takes up the space you would store that in! As for where the magic freezer is that lets them be cold... well, that's unspecified. Maybe the arcane vivarium has a freezer function too XD\n\n* The reason those CRs are high is that this subclass is meant to be played in a campaign where the PCs' goal is to fight monsters and eat them. The 18+ and 21+ CR creatures would be too strong for a PC at 15th level - but, even after earning the capstone, the party theoretically continues to level up, until they hit 20. At that point, they would presumably have bested some CR 18 monsters, and be able to defeat CR 21 monsters as well. This capstone essentially unlocks more features as you level up, essentially bleeding out of just a 15th level feature and continuing to evolve with you until 20th level. There's also the matter of being able to buy those monster parts so that you don't have to defeat them (DM-dependent, of course), or possibly acquiring multiple parts together. Also, a CR 18 monster unlocks 4 of the 6 effects on that table. The feature does not restrict you from having only one benefit at a time, so it's possible to achieve immunity to multiple conditions. That can be a bit strong at 15th level, though.\n\n* Cook's utensils didn't seem appropriate to me once the arcane vivarium as a spellcasting component was introduced, and none of its features rely on the artificer actively using them in a combat context. But yes, it would still make sense for them to have it. I can add that.\n\n---\n\n* Those crafting times are the magic scroll crafting times in the 2024 PHB, which are already shorter than the Tasha rules or the 2014 rules. A legendary item takes that much time and money to create, and these magic item foods are magic items first and foremost, and so they obey those rules. The idea is that you don't want the party to create 20 legendary items in 2 days - somewhat of an exaggeration, but if you were able to produce a legendary item with any form of swiftness, it wouldn't be legendary.\n\n---\n\nI seem to have written too much again.

But maybe not use the same HP as your wizard for the animated armor at lvl 14. Give it its own hit dice. Because if you combine it with the tough feat its very useful, maybe abit to much protection. You can still use the same hitdice as the wizard. Maybe just don't add the con. Just 49(14d6) hp. And every level for the wizard add a hitdice. For a max of 70hp. \nOr let it depend on the type of armor they use. \nLight: 35(14d4)\nMedium: 49(14d6)\nHeavy: 63(14d8)\n(Andin this case do not let it lvl-up with the wizard) So they need more heavy armor/ have to chose between strongest armor for themselfs+ a weaker buddy or weaker armor for themselfs+ stronger buddy.",

And you KNOW we had to staff it with all sorts of new Blank horrors to keep the captured mages in line while they await interrogating. Check out the Blank Sentinel for Monster Monday! \n\nBlank sentinels are the terrors of prisoners everywhere. These horrid monsters were once men and women, now contorted by the Blank’s technology beyond recognition. Usually, Blank sentinels are “reconditioned” deserters or dissidents, though transformation into a sentinel has often also been the punishment for Blank soldiers who are caught sleeping at their posts. Sentinels serve as ever-watchful guards in Blank prisons, often utilized in maximum security areas where the most dangerous mages and members of the Arcanuum are confined. Their various forms of vision presented by their camera-like eyes, and ability to find and destroy material components aids them both in finding escaped prisoners or detecting infiltrators within a prison, as well as removing materials from spellcasters when they enter prisons.\n\nGrab this month’s entire 60+ page release, and get access to over 1800+ pages of previous content when you join the patreon!

A class.\n\n  \n**Spell-Rocker**\n\n \n\nOffensive spell-casters and healers who manipulate the magic of life with music from their Rune Guitars.\n\n \n\nAll Spell Rockers must be armed with a Rune Guitar of no less than six strings. If a player attempts to steal a Spell-Rockers Rune Guitar, whether successful or not, they will receive the debuff “Not cool, man!”\n\n \n\nIf two Spell-rockers confront each other on the battlefield, either one may challenge the other to an Epic Rock-Off!\n\n \n\nAny Spell-Rocker whose hair does not extend beyond their shoulders will have no choice but to bear the title of “pussy” until hair of proper length has been attained. This does not affect stats or abilities, but is, nevertheless, considered uncool.\n\n \n\nAny Spell-Rocker who sells their Rune Guitar for money, or just gets rid of it without replacing it, loses access to their powers and must carry the title of “Sell-out,” until a new Rune Guitar is obtained.  \n\n \n\nGetting rid of older, less-powerful Rune Guitars requires a ritual of burning, while playing the new Rune Guitar over it. This must be done every time a Spell-rocker updates their weapon in order to avoid the title of “Sell-out.” Having this ritual take place while a Lightning storm is going on will increase damage dealt by all offensive spells by +2 for the duration of the storm + 2 hours.",

                    "body": "I'm working on this class based around the concept of a character turning into a weapon (heavily inspired by Soul Eater haha). So far I have some class abilties/features and subclasses, but any suggestions on where to take the class beyond 5th level would be helpful as well as any critiques/edit suggestions/advice is very welcome and would be very helpful. I also haven't yet decided on things like starting hit die, proficiencies, etc. beyond the fact I want the class to be intelligence stat based primarily. \n\n**Ingot**\n\n*War Shape* \\- Starting at first level you can use an action to magically assume the shape of a simple or martial weapon you have seen before and carefully studied to the point of. You can only assume the shape of one type of weapon, which can be selected from either the simple or martial weapon list. You can revert back to your normal form by using a bonus action on your turn. If you are broken or destroyed in war shape you instantly revert back to your normal form and cannot use this ability again until you have completed a long or short rest. \n\n*Phantom Sense* \\- While in War Shpe, any ally creature that has held you within the past 24 hours is able to freely telepathically communicate with you while they are within 30 feet of them. If an ally is actively holding you, you can hear, see, smell, touch, and taste what they do as if you were sensing it yourself. \n\n*Phantasmal Strike* \\- At first level, if you are being wielded by an ally creature while in War Shape, you can use an action to magically compel that creature to immediately make one attack using you as their weapon to do so. \n\n*Imbued Weapon Expertise* \\- At 2nd level any ally creature wielding you in War Shape has proficiency in your War Shape weapon type(s) while holding you if they aren’t already proficient. \n\n*War Path* \\- at 3rd level choose one of three subclasses to represent which path your character is taking as an Ingot.\n\nSubclasses:\n\n\n\n**Reaver**\n\nBloodlust - At 3rd level while an ally wields you in War Shape, whenever that ally succeeds on a weapon attack using you and reduces an enemy to below half their hit point maximum you can use your reaction to deal necrotic damage to yourself equal to twice your level + your intelligence modifier to grant that ally a bonus to their damage rolls equal to the damage you caused yourself until the end of their next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a short or long rest. \n\n\n\n**Witchcrafted**\n\nArcane Focus - At 3rd level an ally that holds you in War Shape can wield you as a spellcasting focus, and while doing so is granted a bonus to their constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell equal to your intelligence modifier. Also, when using phantasmal strike, you can alternatively compel your ally wielding you to immediately cast a cantrip instead of making a weapon attack. \n\n\n\n**Gulbrand**\n\nParry and Riposte - At 3rd level, you can use your reaction when an enemy is making a weapon attack against the ally creature wielding you in war shape to impose a penalty to the enemy’s attack roll equal to your intelligence modifier. If the attack misses, then that ally currently wielding you gets a bonus to their next attack roll against the same enemy equal to your intelligence modifier. You can only use this feature if the ally wielding you can see the enemy attacking them. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a short or long rest. \n\n\n\n*Semblance* \\- At 3rd level while outside of War Shape you can hold a magical weapon or spellcasting focus (if you are on the Witchcrafted war path) in your hands for one hour and copy all of its properties except for what type of weapon or spellcasting focus it is. After copying these properties your War Shape will contain those same stat increases and bonus features unless you spend an hour in quiet meditation releasing those properties. If you use this ability again with another magical object, the previous properties absorbed get erased and completely overwritten. \n\n*Phantom Return* \\- When you reach level 4 you can use a bonus action while in War Shape to teleport up to 60 feet into the hand(s) of any ally that has held you in War Shape within the past hour. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and recover all uses after finishing a short or long rest. \n\n*Lethal Adaptability* \\- At 5th level you can now assume the shape of two types of weapon when using War Shape, the second of which can be selected from either the simple or martial weapon list. ",

This is a fully comprehensive, 145 page compendium that contains everything you’d need to play in, or run, a Modern or Cyberpunk Game in 5e! With 18 new subclasses, 50 new spells or ‘spellprograms,’ 24 new enemy stat blocks from CR ½ to CR 30, 28 new vehicles, 28 new armors, 80 new weapons (including melee armaments and firearms), a whopping 251 new items ranging from an entirely new equipment list, armor modules, weapon modules, cybernetic enhancements, narcotics, and magic items, alongside new character options and alternate rules, this compendium has got you covered!\n\nSince Reddit only allows for 20 images per carousel, I will be back soon so all of this can be released to you for free here on Reddit, but if you want the whole thing now, or you want to support a small D&D creator, you can find it on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/koathedm)! Not only will you get the entirety of this compendium that I've been working on for months now, but you also get access to all of my posts early and you get to see the most updated versions of my posts as I get feedback from y'all! Everything I make comes to down to Reddit, but if you want to support me, please consider being a patron!",

Known by scholars, mages, and wise men throughout the world, she is worshipped in many darkened corners and tribal societies as a deity of decay, of transformation, and of life blooming from the leftovers of death. Those who are learned in her lore know that she is no goddess, but an archfey of the old world, who once strode the mortal world freely when the realms of men and those of fey were not so distant as today.\n\nHow will you be using her in your game I wonder? Let us know below! \n\nThe Maiden of Spores is part of our November Adventure & STL Release - Curse of the Spore-Queen.
