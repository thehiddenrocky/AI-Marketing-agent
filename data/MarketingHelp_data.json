            "selftext": "Took us a while to crack the code, but we finally built an influencer marketing team that scales efficiently. Sharing our exact blueprint because I see so many others struggling with this.\n\nFirst of all, know when to build an in-house team:\n\n* You're consistently seeing good ROI from influencer campaigns\n* You're managing 10+ active creators at any time\n* Agency fees are approaching a full-time salary\n* Creators are reaching out wanting to work directly with your brand\n\nHere's the exact process that worked for us:\n\n1st hire:\n\nYour first hire needs to be a lead who can build systems from scratch. Don't get hung up on years of experience. I hired someone who managed their own social media presence and was incredibly organized. They built our entire process from the ground up.\n\n2nd hire:\n\nWhen your lead starts spending most of their time on admin work, that's when you need a coordinator. This person handles the operations - shipping, payments, contracts, content organization. We use Saral to automate a lot of this stuff now, but back then it was pure chaos with spreadsheets.\n\n3rd hire:\n\nThe final piece is a partnership manager, but only when you're running lots of campaigns. They focus purely on creator relationships while your lead handles strategy. This was game-changing for us - suddenly we could actually nurture our top creators instead of just managing them.\n\nBiggest tip someone gave me is -- Just because you've hired people doesn't mean you should skimp on tools. We wasted a few weeks trying to run everything through spreadsheets before discovering saral. Good tools are way cheaper than burning out your team or missing deliverables.\n\nHas anyone else here built an in-house influencer marketing team? Curious about what signs made you realize it was time to build vs outsource vs DIY.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjirmfju901e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f16ca6073173cb396daec32c2beab53353b6131\n\n",

Honestly, I was blown away when I saw the results—my sales increased by 47%! This helped me hit my annual targets and significantly increase revenue, even though I never expected just a video could have this kind of impact.\n\nFor me, it started out small. I was just learning the basics of creating content, figuring out the best way to engage audiences, and using videos effectively. It wasn’t easy at first, but over time, I realized I could reach numbers I’d only dreamed of.\n\nI know that many people feel video creation is complex and overwhelming, but if you’re one of those, I’d recommend trying [Instadoodle](https://instadoodle.com/cb-special?&shield=5a0047o0o3eilheezl34oku4zv&ad=ecom). It’s a quick and easy tool that helps you create high-quality videos, even if you don’t have a lot of experience.\n\nI’m sharing this not to brag, but to motivate anyone in this field, especially if you're feeling stuck or unsure where to begin. Sometimes, just one small step, like adding video to your marketing content, can make all the difference in your career path.\n\nKeep going, keep experimenting, and learn from your mistakes. Over time, you might just see results that exceed your expectations.",

Once you get over the initial hump, videos are fantastic for storytelling and really grabbing people’s attention. It’s wild how a few well-placed and well-crafted videos can shift your presence. Anyone hesitant should definitely give it a try!",

So, I decided to put together this list [https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional-Bear-3950/comments/1gmf7jv/the\\_best\\_marketing\\_tools\\_for\\_indie\\_hackers\\_2024](https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional-Bear-3950/comments/1gmf7jv/the_best_marketing_tools_for_indie_hackers_2024), specifically tailored for solo founders or small teams with limited resources. This isn’t just a general tool roundup—you’ll notice the focus is different, with choices that match the unique needs of indie hackers.\n\nFor instance, with outreach tools, I’m sticking to LinkedIn since it’s one of the most effective platforms for outreach and cold DMs (I don’t think X is the right place for cold DMs). And when it comes to social media trend monitoring, I’m focusing on Reddit-specific tools, because Reddit is a key marketing battleground for indie developers. Whether it's finding the best subreddits to post in beyond just saas and sideproject (I’m sure you know the pain), or discovering user pain points that are often missed, Reddit provides invaluable insights when used strategically.\n\n**This list also gives you a few helpful hacks**—like alternatives for tools with limits. For example, if you’re using Similarweb but want more than 25 free uses per week, I’ve included some options that let you keep going without hitting the cap.",

Reddit’s a goldmine for tapping into niche communities and getting honest feedback. Pulse for Reddit can really give you an edge by engaging effectively and naturally joining discussions—extremely useful if you’re looking to build a community or just get direct insights on your product. If you’re into cold outreach on LinkedIn, tools like Hunter.io can help streamline contact discovery and outreach. With these, indie hackers can maximize their impact with minimal resources.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAs a marketer for early-stage startups, I've found myself stuck in the same spot from one project to the next. When I needed to understand *why* my tactics to attract first leads weren’t working, it often felt like I was on my own. From podcasts to competitive intelligence tools, so much advice is focused on scaling established companies—and finding actionable metrics for brand-new projects felt impossible.\n\nThat’s why I started thinking about how valuable it would be for first-time founders and growth marketers to have a place to share real, 0-to-1 stories. I believe that by learning from each other’s first steps and challenges, we could all grow faster and avoid some of the common pitfalls in early lead generation.\n\nSo I’m here with two goals:\n\n1. To find folks who might want to test this concept of a community-driven resource for early lead generation.\n2. To connect with marketers and founders who have already cracked the code on finding those first leads and might be open to sharing their insights.\n\nIf you’ve ever asked yourself questions like:\n\n* “Why aren’t my website visitors converting into leads?”\n* “Why do my social posts have no reach?”\n* “Why isn’t my outreach getting responses?”\n\n…you’re probably facing the same challenges I was! If you’d like to explore or contribute to a resource around these early-stage hurdles, drop a comment or DM me. I’d love to hear your experiences or tell you more about what I’m working on. Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their stories or wants to collaborate\n\nI'll be sharing the link in the comms",

It can take months before someone actually decides to sign up, so keeping leads engaged during that time has been tricky.\n\nTo help with this, I’ve been using **Warpleads’ technological filter** to pull in leads that are likely to be interested in our product. The challenge I’ve faced is finding a way to stay in touch with these leads without feeling like I’m constantly pushing a sale. I’ve tried sharing useful articles, industry insights, and case studies that show how our product can solve real problems for businesses.\n\nIt’s been a bit of trial and error, but I’ve seen some results and over the last couple of months, I’ve managed to close **64 sales** just by staying consistent with emails and adding value. But I’m still wondering how to keep the engagement going without bombarding them with constant emails.\n\nSo, I’m curious: how do you keep leads engaged in a long sales cycle? Do you focus on educational content, or something else? Would love to hear your experiences!\n\nThanks!",

This shows immediate value. Also, consider hosting webinars or Q&A sessions - it's a great way to showcase expertise without the hard sell.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m reaching out to share a situation I recently encountered in my small marketing business, and I’d love to hear your thoughts or advice.\n\nI started my own marketing consultancy last year and have been working hard to build relationships with my clients. Recently, I found out that a business partner I relied on for hosting services—specifically, an employee of theirs—has begun teaching one of my clients about SEO, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads—services that I’ve been providing for them. This client is also hosted by them, and that’s where this connection happened. As a result, my client has chosen to end our collaboration, which is incredibly disappointing and has significant consequences for my business.\n\nAs a small company, this situation hits hard. I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into building trust and delivering value to my clients, and it feels like a betrayal when overlapping services occur, especially since this employee knew about my existing relationship with the client.\n\nI find it particularly troubling that this kind of practice is happening while I am still a customer of theirs. It feels like a lack of respect for my business and the effort I’ve put in to establish myself in this competitive field.\n\nI’m considering my options moving forward, including potentially seeking compensation for the losses I've incurred, but I also want to find a way to address this ethically without causing unnecessary conflict.\n\nHave any of you faced a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on navigating this kind of professional overlap would be greatly appreciated.",

Our program was decent but nothing special - about 50 active creators bringing maybe 5-10 sales each per month.\n\nThen I noticed something while studying Goli (they're crushing it in supplements). Instead of flat commissions, they use a **tiered structure: 10-25% based on performance.** But the genius is in how they space these tiers:\n\n* 0-5 sales: 10% (easy first win)\n* 6-12 sales: 15% (feels achievable)\n* 13-25 sales: 20% (bigger stretch)\n* 26+ sales: 25% (keeps them motivated)\n\nThe early tiers are intentionally easy to hit. Once creators taste success, they push harder for higher tiers. Goli's whole system **is built around making creators successful:**\n\n* Pro photo library so influencers don't struggle with product shots\n* Talking points to prevent wild health claims\n* Posting guidelines with suggestions for the best times\n* Unique codes to track everything\n\nThey turn creator content into marketing assets. About 1/3rd of their Instagram is actually influencer content. Same with their emails. Way more authentic than studio shots.\n\nDoes anyone here run influencer programs? Curious if you've tried different commission structures and what worked/didn't work. \n\n*P.S. I have detailed notes on Goli's influencer strategy. Let me know in the comments if you want to see it. I'll share.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m6j2xsrgtuxd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8aa07aabc752a7fcab5f6a0bbf181f5d2a417ec\n\n",

Maybe they used it at an old job, maybe they have been hearing about it for years.\n\nThey haven't actually heard about buffer, but upon any external research (review sites, reddit) they will get the details they need.\n\nSo for a company like this, your hero headline and body copy need to help you differentiate, handle objections, and disqualify people you don't want using your tool.\n\nUsually, the following little piece of copy would never make it onto the top of a homepage:\n\n\"We're a values driven company...\" \n\nBut I think it helps them find their ideal customer. They are way beyond the growth stage after all.\n\nMy one piece of negative criticism here?\n\nTheir attempt to outwardly define their ICP is as follows:\n\n\"For ambitious people and teams\".\n\nI don't think that helps or provides any value to them or the reader, and I would love to hear an argument that defends it. \n\nWhat do you think?

            "selftext": "After nearly blowing our entire Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) budget on ads last year, I've learned my lesson. This year, we're investing in influencer marketing as well. Here's our game plan to crush BFCM sales without burning cash:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jcxrnzq95vwd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f1eedb69f4aa3036e988feb030d0a7fdc71f5aa\n\n* **Starting early:** We're already in talks with influencers, 3 months before BFCM. This early outreach lets us:\n   * Secure top-tier influencers before they're booked solid\n   * Give influencers time to plan creative, authentic content\n   * Build relationships for long-term collaborations beyond BFCM\n* **Creating gift-ready bundles:** We're designing holiday-themed product boxes that are perfect for gifting. These bundles:\n   * Make for visually appealing unboxing videos, boosting social media engagement\n   * Simplify the shopping experience for customers looking for ready-made gifts\n   * Allow us to showcase multiple products together, increasing average order value\n* **Setting up influencer challenges:** We've created a tiered reward system for our influencers:\n   * $500 bonus for generating 20 orders\n   * 10% commission for first 10 sales, 15% for 11-20, 20% beyond that\n   * Luxury getaway for the top-selling influencer\n\nThis structure incentivizes consistent promotion throughout the BFCM period.\n\n* **Crafting a comprehensive BFCM guideline doc:** Our guide includes:\n   * Specific posting dates and times\n   * Required content formats (e.g., Stories, Reels, feed posts) for each platform\n   * Key messaging points about our BFCM deals and unique selling propositions\n   * Pre-designed graphics and suggested captions for easy sharing\n* **Leveraging influencer content for cart recovery:** We're integrating influencer-generated content into our abandonment strategy:\n   * Adding influencer testimonials to cart abandonment emails\n   * Using product demos in retargeting ads to address common objections\n   * Creating urgency with influencer-exclusive, time-limited offers in recovery campaigns\n* **Optimizing influencer discount codes:** Our influencers will offer exclusive discounts. For example, 25% off through influencer codes vs. 20% site-wide BFCM discount. This gives their audience a reason to use their code, motivating influencers to promote more.\n* **Implementing advanced coupon code protection:** We're using a tool (getsaral) to help us generate unique, time-restricted coupon codes for each affiliate link click. It will prevent coupon code leaks on coupon sites.\n\nWhat's your BFCM plan this year? Anything we can all learn from?\n\n",

For the longest time, we thought the best way to engage our customers was by sending daily emails with promotions, sales, and product updates. But after a few months, we noticed our open rates were plummeting, and people were unsubscribing at a higher rate than we’d like to admit.\n\nThat’s when I took a step back and realized we were sending too many emails and that we needed a more targeted, value-driven approach. I started by using **Warpleads** to expor**t unlimited leads**, which was a huge help for staying within budget. Then, I verified those leads with **Reoon**, which has been fantastic for ensuring that our emails actually reach real people.\n\nI also switched up our approach by using **Instantly** to find more **niche leads** and send emails in a more organized way. We focused less on selling and more on providing value. For example, instead of sending generic promo emails, we started sharing customer stories, eco-tips, and behind-the-scenes content.\n\nThe results have been awesome. Our open rates went up by around 15%, and we’re seeing much higher engagement. We’re no longer sending daily emails, now it’s just 2-3 a week, and the feedback has been much more positive.\n\nWhat email metrics do you focus on to measure success? I’m especially interested in how you measure engagement, as it’s been a big focus for us lately.",

I loved working with clients, but between training sessions, meal planning, updating my website, responding to messages, and keeping up with my social media, I often felt like I was running in circles. Every day, I’d find myself saying, \"I’ll get to that later,\" but then nothing ever got done.\n\nI’d have a to-do list a mile long, but by the end of the day, I’d only checked off a few things. It left me feeling unproductive and honestly, pretty overwhelmed.\n\nA friend of mine recommended **Hyperdone**, and I was a little skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a shot. It helped me break my day into manageable chunks, like setting aside time for client sessions, social media, meal planning, and admin tasks. Instead of jumping from one thing to another, I actually started to focus.\n\nNow, I’m not only getting more done in less time, but I’ve been able to grow my client base because I’m more organized. I don’t feel like I’m constantly catching up anymore. I’m actually present with my clients, and I can focus on growing my business.\n\nAnyone else here a trainer? How do you stay productive everyday?",

There's 101 reasons or delays that we cause for ourselves because we get nervy about our decisions and putting our work/effort out there and it won't get better unless you simply start. \n\n  \nThe second thing I would advise is to learn from your competition. Study people who are already out there doing the same thing as you and marketing themselves well, and see what's working for them. Don't copy them and their content but definitely look at their style of content creation what type of content they're creating etc and try to replicate that. \n\n  \nAnother thing that has worked well for me is stepping outside of my niche and seeing what people besides my direct competition are doing and what has been working for them. This really helps you get inspired.",

I checked some main socials i.e. Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok and there's definitely a lot lacking in regular posting since there's no one delegated specifically to social media. And with the posts that there are, the engagement is really low. They have a focus on me creating short form videos to appeal to people my age, older gen Z and younger millennials. I'm mostly worried about my ideas not being fruitful enough to make this a long term job opportunity for me. The imposter syndrome is kicking in hard 😅",

Knowing your ICP can really help you zero in on the connecting the dots between the small internet show's value and who may be interested. Make a list of the show the value provides and the use that information to start some of your social posts... if that is where your audience hangs out. Check out SparkToro if you want to get a better idea of where your audience hangs out. You can use it for free for some initial research.  \n\nAs an intern, you are in a great position. Why? You're an intern. There's not a lot of pressure or expectation.  Use this to your advantage. I actually think you can use this opportunity to brand yourself by starting out as \"The Marketing Intern\".  Ask for help in all your posts. Ask to be referred to people that would enjoy the show. Then use that information to better target your messages. Tell people about the show, talk about what you've tried and how you are trying to build up the social presence. Put it all out there where people can see your struggles and your wins. Pull clips from the show if it is visual. Talk about the good, the bad, the ugly of being \"the intern\".  \n\nThroughout the process, you will learn a ton about what your company does. You'll get a bunch of ideas and comments that you can sift through, you'll have some fun, you'll build your own personal following that you can leverage later, and you'll walk away with a much greater sense of accomplishment for marketing than you would ever receive doing office work.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve always struggled with staying disciplined and focused, especially when managing multiple projects. I’m currently balancing a few side hustles while also working full-time. For a long time, I would start projects with great intentions, but then lose steam halfway through and never finish them. It felt like a constant cycle of starting and not finishing.\n\nThat all changed when I started using **Hyperdone**. The **Today view** feature has been a lifesaver for me—it helps me organize my tasks and prioritize what I need to get done each day. Before, I was constantly jumping from task to task without making real progress. Now, I can see exactly what I need to focus on and what’s most urgent.\n\nWhat really made a difference though was using the **Pomodoro timer**. I’d never really used it before, but once I tried it, I realized how much more focused I could be when I worked in short bursts. It also helped me avoid the habit of procrastinating because I knew I only had to commit to working for 25 minutes at a time.\n\nI’ve noticed a huge improvement in my productivity, and I’m finally finishing projects on time, with a lot less stress. Does anyone else here use the Pomodoro method or a similar productivity hack to stay on track?",

It’s the most affordable solution I’ve found, especially since I can pull in as many leads as I need for outreach. However, there are times when I need a more specific set of leads, especially for niche markets, and that’s where **Apollo** comes in. I use Apollo when WarpLeads doesn’t have exactly what I’m looking for.\n\nOnce I have my leads, I use **Reoon** to validate them. Reoon’s been fantastic in helping ensure that my emails aren’t bouncing and that I’m reaching out to real prospects.\n\nI guess the takeaway here is that **WarpLeads** is my core tool for lead generation, and **Apollo** just helps me expand into those areas I wouldn’t find otherwise. Anyone else using a combination of tools for lead generation? What works best for you?",

It's like having a 24/7 assistant that does the heavy lifting of targeting, finding, and analyzing opportunities. Plus, it crafts personalized replies, which saves me so much time.Have you considered adding a tool that focuses on social media lead gen to your stack? It might complement your current setup nicely.

I personally don't believe that would be the case because of other reasons like brand safety and measurement abilities.\n\n\nWhat is happening in my network is that brands that do programmatic and search advertising are focusing on marketing measurement and attribution, using tools like Supermetrics and DoubleVerify. Recently, an Adalytics report found programmatic ads running next to inappropriate content. So, measuring and tracking campaigns is one focus for us.\n\n\nThey also want the same solutions for social media to make sure their ads are targeting the right audiences. The recent controversies surrounding Meta running drug ads and brand ads showing up alongside sensitive content are a huge concern. While we can measure the performance of social ad campaigns and make sense of our ROI, there is a need to collect first-party data to make sure we don't end up somewhere sensitive or negative.\n\n\nThat's kind of the case for our brands. What about you?\n",

To explain my question, I just started a marketing job about a month ago and it’s going well so far. My primary responsibilities getting started have been content creation and getting structure in place for marketing as a department. This role is new to the company, it’s a small traditional company that does utility sales.\n\nNow my background is as a multimedia designer, with very limited actual marketing experience. The company knows and is ok with this. My question is, when it comes to stuff like running ad campaigns, doing analytics, keyword/trend research, etc, what are some resources that I can look at to learn more about the fundamentals and best tools of the trade?\n\nLooking for anything from reading materials, platform recommendations, and general advice. Any help getting my feet wet here is greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance to anyone who responds!",

Be careful not to in prison your self with pre historic SEO rules this is an issue that I see a lot of people do. You need to understand in depth what Google want and also how to work very closely with Google if your want to provide your clients the best service. Even though Google is not “ the internet “ they sort of dictate how well your client will do and also how much traffic you can get to their sites etc. I’m not sure how much your company expect from you. This is more advice targeting around your key word research and getting traffic into your clients sites via key words. Research with an open mind and use trial and error. Get a Good relationship with Google search console and analytics, before I set up my media arm I created 1 websites and done trial and error SEO on it, might be worth considering this. Hope there is something within all this that can help. If you have a more direct question or any help needed just fire it over in PM.",

                    "body": "I suggest you start your journey by understanding your intended target customer inside and out. Define your Ideal Customer Profile, get on calls with the sales team, support calls, whatever you can. This will help you understand the customer, their needs, challenges, expectations and it will help you understand what the company has previously tried from a marketing and sales perspective, what has worked and what has not worked. This will save you a ton of time. Think of it as your foundation. This understanding is needed before you start creating campaigns, buying platforms, and keyword searches, etc. It will save you a ton of time as you go forward. Plus, the better you align yourself now with what sales needs to sell, you'll be a better marketer. Next, focus in on understanding the company's goals, so you can determine which company objectives you want to try to influence first. For small organizations, the owner's want more sales, more pipeline, etc. that lead to revenue. Of the many different shiny objects that will be in front of you Web design, demos (if applicable), SEO, trade shows, email marketing, ...etc. you'll need to stay focused on the activities that have the greatest impact to pumping leads into the sales pipeline. \n\nYou'll need to create a strategy and a plan for how you want to approach only the highest and best use of your time because you can't do it all by yourself, so there's no need to try. You'll get bogged down and depressed. \n\nStart small and build from there. Start with a single channel first and get it operating smoothly and delivering for you in a way that helps you attain your goals before venturing off to the next shiny object. Seriously, be super disciplined about how you spend your time.  Recall conversations from the sales team to help find a great starting place.\n\nIf you are starting without any sort of metrics or baseline data, then you'll need to establish it. As others have mentioned SEMrush and other tools can help with SEO analysis, traffic etc., Google Search Console can help too if your site is already up and running. You can use the free tools within Google Ads to learn about keywords and monthly search volume. You don't have to spend money on ads to use these tools.  \n\nYou mentioned content. Before you create any other pieces of content, make sure you have completed the earlier steps I suggested. It's a waste of time and money if you are creating content without knowing who you are targeting and the types of jobs your target is trying to solve or the problems they have. Focus your content on clearly demonstrating you understand their issues and how your service/product aligns with their needs. Focus on the benefits they receive and not the features of your product.",

                    "body": "Yeah, it works. I run 2 B2B businesses -- a B2B email outreach agency (OutreachBloom) and a b2b SaaS (EmailAnalytics).\n\nIf cold outreach isn't working for you because nobody replies, I'd bet that your deliverability is shit. In other words, you are sending emails straight into people's spam folders. People aren't gonna respond to those ;) Cold email outreach works really well but it has gotten a lot harder over the past few months.\n\nHere's what's working for us:\n\n1. Cold email outreach:\n   - Use a b2b lead database (Apollo, ZoomInfo, RevenueBase, etc) to get email addresses of people in your target audience\n   - Clean the list to remove bad emails (lots of tools do this)\n   - Use a cold outreach sending platform to send emails (Smartlead, Instantly, etc)\n   - Keep daily volume under 25 emails per address\n   - Use multiple domains & email addresses to scale up daily sends\n   - Use unique messaging. Don't sound like every other email they get.\n   - Test deliverability regularly, and expect (and plan for) your deliverability to go down the tube eventually. Have backup accounts ready to go when (not if) that happens. Deliverability is the hardest part of cold outreach these days.\n\n2. LinkedIn outreach / content marketing:\n   - Use Sales Navigator to build a list of your target audience.\n   - Send InMails to people with open profiles (it doesn't cost any credits to send InMails to people with open profiles). One bonus of InMails is that the recipient also gets an email with the content of the InMail, which means that they get a LI DM and an email into their inbox (without any worry about deliverability!). Two for one.\n   - Engage with their posts to build relationships\n   - Make posts to share your own content that would interest your followers. Be consistent.\n\n3. SEO & content marketing. It's a long-term play but worth it. Content marketing includes your website (for SEO), and social media. Find where your target audience hangs out (ie, what social media channels) and participate in conversations there.\n\nNomatter what lead-gen activities you do, it's all about persistence and consistency, tbh.",

Without a serious, consistent effort to personalize across all of your ABM accounts, it won't work. B2B demand generation should be called ad spend management, because that's the vast majority of what they do. Lead with content.",

They can be expensive though. As it's B2B, even little search volume could still make sense to run ads for if the keywords are highly relevant. There should also always be competitors you can target, and more awareness type keywords higher up in the buyer journey can work as well and can be cheaper to target. Whether people will fill out the lead form will also be much dependent on the landing page and sales copy on the page.\n\nOr we run Meta or LinkedIn ads. These are not that good for lead generation though as they have less intent. But they can work well if you have a great offer. We usually use them with a free offer, like a free trial or a lead magnet or a webinar. It's more of a strategy to get people in the door, then you need to have a strong sales process, high trial conversion rates, and/or long-term nurturing. Meta ads also work well for retargeting and you'd often need long-term retargeting as B2B conversion timeframes can be much longer.\n\nHope this helps! There are some strategy walkthroughs linked on my profile that might be of interest.",

Define that person very, very clearly, very narrowly. Then try to think like that person.\n\nWhere do they spend their time? Don't mistake the cliches that business people are so busy that they never open social media - it's not true. They spend time on tiktok, Instagram, playing silly games, etc. So, don't picture a glorified version of that person, but a real one. And as vulgar as it may sound, but while they are on the toilet, they are not reading Bloomberg, they are watching tiktok or reading reddit.\n\nMore importantly - what is their mindset when they use a specific platform? The context in which they use it. Provide that, separately on each platform. The biggest mistake is doing the same content on all platforms. The user intent is different on Instagram reels than it is on tiktok. Yes both are short videos, but the user expectation is different. (and completely different on LinkedIn for example) \n\nAll content in its core needs to be educational and/or emotional and/or entertaining. \n\nMy advice would be creating a lot of content, with variations in length and style for each platform. Take the best performing videos and boost them.\n\nThe content shouldn't be about your company and your solution. It should be about your client's problems (or needs). State the problem (let them identify themselves with it), show deep understanding of it (make them believe that you are an expert), then offer a solution, and cement it with a proof (\"and we know this because we've done it for xyz company). \n\nThen, once you have a solid viewership - go with banners (targeting the same audience as the boost). At that point you are a known entity to your potential customers and the banner is a reminder for them to click (a much more direct CTA, because they already have been primed by your content).\n\nUnfortunately... For B2B - there are no shortcuts in marketing. I know everyone wants to hear that if they do this one thing all of a sudden they'll get tons of clients (the promise of every lead generation company), but I've never seen it work - not for small companies, not for multinationals.",

With B2C it’s more transactional and you don’t have to spend time educating your audiences on aspects such as service, quality, systems etc.\n\nGet used to playing the long game.",

I’ve been watching lumosity as a case study, as I’ve found them really interesting seeing they’re a SAS model. Anyways, you have two options as I see it.\n\n1. Find a local agency that is creative and social media focused. Instruct them to create a campaign that is carried by humor. I think your audience will be more inclined to retain and connect with the content, but if they’re actually able to make them laugh, they will associate you with positivity and may be more inclined to further interact with your campaign. I had a client who I created a funny commercial for have overwhelming organic success to the point where it is a recurring theme on their social now. You should at least A/B test it to see how it performs.\n\n2. DIY. I know you’re not a “cool person” but day in the life videos go a long way if you can create a format. It has nothing to do with being ‘cool’ it has everything to do with energy and consistency. I have a friend who asked me for guidance on growing a YouTube channel about filleting fish whom i told to post on tik tok 3 times a day. His organic success is now overwhelming in under 2 years. His entire life has changed because he was able to commit to himself to stick with a social regimen.\n\nYou should not :\n1. Hire an employee. You will probably have to pay a payroll tax on them, and unless you find gods gift to social media marketing, you’ll be shooting in the dark for months.\n\n2. Pass off the fast to a gen Z family member. I see it every day, seriously- it’s a terrible idea.\n\nGood luck!",

If it takes off, you could always build out a separate site later. For now, I feel like a well-crafted landing page could do the job just fine. Plus, it's way easier to manage from an SEO and content perspective. Just my two cents though!",

I am currently in school and I’m torn on whether I should pursue a Bachelor’s in Marketing Communications with a concentration in Graphic Design or if I should get a Bachelor’s in Business Administration. Is it hard to find a well paying job in the marketing field? Are there more remote job opportunities for marketing? \n\nI honestly just don’t want to waste my time and I want to get a degree in something that will be useful. The Business Administration degree seems more broad, but it just looks so boring and difficult. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! ",

I am technically already working in a job cause it’s a work/studying course.\nHere’s what I can tell you :\n1) Everybody freak out about the same 2 things in my year group : are we going to find a job after our degree ? Are we going to get well paid for our future job ? \nSo if you want to go for this master degree do it cause you really love marketing and communication because you’ll need to work absolutely everytime and everywhere unless you don’t want to be different than the other billions of ppl who have the same degree lol\n2) specialize yourself in a specific field : it’s great to know a bit everything but if you want to focus on the strategy marketing aspect go for it a 100%. If you prefer Graphic Design then go and specialize yourself in this field. In the job markket there are already a tone of people that are average in everything. \n3) after knowing what do you want to do exactly make sure to work in the field you want. Health care, social, environment, fashion…. \nWork on a good portfolio. \n4) Monitors the new trends\n5) Cultivate your creativity consistently. Whatever you do you actually. Test stuffs, try new things.\n6) Start up are fun to work with at the beginning but watch out and beware of a burn out. Know your limits. Try bigger projects with bigger companies.\n7) Freelance isnt the solution for everything but it can be helpful. When you leave a company (end of internship contract for instance) it might be the time you make them your clients. \n\nIdk if this was helpful, I spent a lot of time to be off topic maybe. \nGood luck with your future projects\n\nPs im french sorry for the syntax mistakes",

            "selftext": "Keeping influencers interested in your brand is tough these days. One minute they're excited, the next they've ghosted you for a competitor. After seeing some partnerships fizzle out (and the sales drop that followed), I had to find some practical ways to keep influencers engaged.\n\nHere are 5 ideas that worked for me:\n\n1— **Find real matches**: Look beyond just follower counts. Check if their style and audience actually fit your brand. A tech company working with a fashion influencer? Probably won't end well. Make sure their followers match who you're trying to sell to.\n\n2— **Share why your affiliate program matters**: Don't just focus on money. Tell influencers about the mission behind your program. When influencers feel connected to a bigger purpose, they're more likely to stick around.\n\n3— **Make the money motivating:** Flat rates get boring. Try using tiers – the more they sell, the higher their cut. You could also give bonuses for really good engagement rates. This gets influencers thinking long-term instead of just cashing quick checks.\n\n4— **Keep in touch (without being pushy)**: Send updates about once a month. Share news about the company, sneak peeks at new products, or ask what they think about upcoming ideas. Don't forget to like and comment on their regular posts too – it shows you actually care.\n\n5— **Create a community feeling**: Set up a way for your influencers to connect with each other. A private social media group can work well. They can share tips and maybe even work together on posts. It makes your brand feel more like a club people want to be part of.\n\nPro tip: Use tools to handle the boring data stuff. This frees up time to actually talk to influencers and build those important relationships. I often use the getsaral app.\n\nWhat's worked (or totally failed) for you when working with influencers? Any tips to add to the list?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1ka0yfd13pd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1c264a7a207d12a667a2a7cd47f2c1a060aa12c\n\n",

            "selftext": "I've been watching a ton of DTC brands pivot from paid ads to affiliate marketing lately. Makes sense - rising ad costs, iOS changes, the whole deal. But most of them are struggling to scale these programs beyond a handful of influencers. If you're in the same boat, I have some insights for you.\n\nAfter digging into some successful brands and talking to DTC founders, there are 5 lessons on how to actually make affiliate marketing work at scale:\n\n1— **Create a dedicated landing page for your program**. It's wild how many brands skip this. A good page clearly explains the program and attracts inbound applications. You won't have to go and chase influencers. Save a lot of your time. Examples of brands doing this: Snif, Wild fragrances, Olipop, HexClad.\n\n2— **Implement tiered rewards**. Flat commission rates are okay, but they don't motivate top performers. Obvi, for example, bumps commissions from 10% to 20% for affiliates who drive 20+ orders. It keeps affiliates pushing for more. Abercrombie offers tiered rewards via challenges.\n\n3— The most successful programs **have hundreds, sometimes thousands of affiliates**. 1st Phorm works with over 4,000 influencers. Even if only 10% are active daily, that's 400 people talking about them. It keeps the brand on top of people's minds. I use the getsaral app to find influencers. \n\n4— **Relationships > transactions.** Pura Vida's CEO claims to have met 90% of their influencers in person. That's dedication. Regular communication, any support from the brand, and being interested in their journey make a huge difference.\n\n5— **Unique perks and benefits demotivate influencers to switch to competitor brands.** Snif (a fragrance brand) offers stuff like direct chats with founders. Can't put a price on that kind of access.\n\nThe brands nailing this stuff are seeing affiliate marketing become a major sales channel.\n\nFor those of you running affiliate programs, what's been the toughest part about scaling? Any creative solutions you've found?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vudqr4ml4xnd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=303a0d749acd82d3444170af391f4d1c9bd97199\n\n",

For context here are the tools we use for our leadgen:\n   * **WarpLeads** - unlimited export leads\n   * **Reoon** - email verifier (quality app too!)\n* ***Personalized Outreach***: Enhanced our email campaigns with more tailored content and offers.\n* ***Consistent Follow-Ups***: Made sure to follow up promptly with leads who showed interest but hadn’t converted yet.\n\nIt’s been a fantastic month, and I’m curious—what sales techniques or strategies have worked best for you in your industry? Any tips or best practices you’d recommend?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nThanks!",

By connecting with platforms like AWS, Azure, and GitHub, it allows developers to focus on creating rather than managing servers or infrastructure.*\n\nI have worked on:\n\n* Social media (Instagram, twitter, facebook, and Linkedin),\n* Email Marketing (drip campaigns),\n* Linkedin Outreach Automation (linked helper),\n* Blog Management (keyword research (semrush) , content and copywriting, on-page SEO optimisation (rankmath and yoast SEO), off-page seo (Quora, Medium, Guest posting)).\n\nBut, as a marketing manager I'd also have to work on new things that I haven't worked on, Like:\n\n* influencer marketing,\n* Run ambassador programs at schools and colleges to increase members of the community,\n* Ad campaigning (PPC, Meta ads),\n* Community building (reddit, slack, github, discord),\n* Hire for relevant roles to create our marketing team and lead them,\n* Create GTM, content, sales, and all sorts of Strategies,\n* Be responsible for every result and provide information before executing anything.\n\nin my earlier jobs, I used to get the tasks and I used to do those and that's it. but as a marketing manager, I'd have to create the whole roadmap and a framework based on which I'd create tasks and then work on those tasks and also delegate to my team.\n\nNow, one of the problems is that I don't have a tech background and there's a big learning curve that I have to overcome to understand the tech I'll be marketing.\n\nThese are some KPIs, I'd have to work towards:\n\n* Grow our community from 650 on Discord to 20,000 members across platforms like Discord, Slack, Reddit, and GitHub, with 25% active engagement and 5% converting to paid users with a 5-10$ average ticket price.\n* Increase our email subscribers from 7,000 to 100,000 with strong engagement rates.\n* Achieve a fully streamlined content calendar across blogs, social media, and all the required channels, ready 1-2 months in advance, every month.\n* Hit around 50k monthly organic traffic from the current 1k monthly traffic.\n* Automate LinkedIn and email outreach flow to drive constant leads.\n* Boost user sign-ups substantially.\n* Connect and create content with influencers.\n\nI would love to get your insights or any resources on:\n\n1. Building an effective GTM strategy for the product I told you about.\n2. Tips on increasing community engagement and membership.\n3. Ideas for creating content that converts for all the required channels.\n4. Techniques for boosting organic traffic and managing large-scale email campaigns.\n5. I have no experience of ads, PPC, or anything in-organic. So, any suggestions or resources that could help.\n6. Any tools, resources, guides, or software recommendations.\n7. A sort of rough roadmap that could help me achieve these KPIs.\n8. Anything you would like to suggest.\n\n**Open to all kinds of comments, follow-up questions, advice and suggestions.**",

From this, we’ve also learnt an awful lot too.\n\nSo, we decided to start a newsletter called Paving Tomorrow, to share real insight, thinking and sometimes, if possible, we’ll show brief behind the scenes of projects. Part of the plan is to launch a podcast in 2025 which we hope will feature the team, past and present clients and also founders/individuals that are building cool brands.\n\nI thought it could be worth sharing in here as it's relevant to branding and hopefully we can bring you some incredible value. I'll drop the link below to subscribe if you're interested.\n\n[https://paving-tomorrow.beehiiv.com/subscribe](https://paving-tomorrow.beehiiv.com/subscribe)\n\nThanks in advance!",

How do you come up with the content ideas. (That's one big thing for B2B), also does meme culture help? \n3.

Even if your product isn't directly related to Instagram, you can still create engaging content by focusing on thought leadership, industry insights, and behind-the-scenes looks at your company. Start by identifying the pain points and interests of your target audience, then create content that addresses those needs. Educational posts, client testimonials, case studies, and infographics can be highly effective. Meme culture can also be useful if it aligns with your brand's tone and adds a relatable, human touch to your content. As for vertical videos, it's perfectly fine to repurpose the same video across Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and LinkedIn, but consider tweaking the captions or descriptions to fit each platform's audience. Scripture writing, or crafting compelling copy, is crucial for any social media content as it helps convey your message clearly and persuasively, driving engagement and conversions.",

It won't essentially provide any value to your followers which is essential for your as a b2b brand. \n\nWhat niche are you guys currently working in? What are businesses similar to your doing and how are their posts performing? If they're not doing too well either that should give you some insight that maybe the right audience for you isn't on a particular platform but if they are then it nudge you in a direction where you can change the trend and start creating content that would resonate with them. \n\nHow do you find stuff that resonates with your audience? \n\nFind content on other mediums/channels that works well in your niche.

It gives you SO much insight on what people like to talk about and changes the way you look at things and create your content. \n\nAlso, keep experimenting with the type of content you're creating.

                    "body": "I understand how challenging it can be to keep up with the rapid changes in the industry, especially when resources are tight. Here’s a practical approach you can take:\n\n1. **Leverage Local Networks**: Reach out to local colleges and universities to connect with students in marketing, communications, or business programs. Many students are eager to gain real-world experience and could be interested in an internship or project-based work that they can add to their resume. You could offer a performance-based contract where they earn a commission or a small payment based on results.\n2. **Focus on Hyper-Local Marketing**: Instead of trying to compete with large platforms and advanced technology head-on, focus on what they can't do as well—personalized, community-driven engagement. Attend local events, get involved in community organizations, and build relationships with local businesses. Your deep knowledge of the local market is something AI can't replicate.\n3. **Social Media and Content Creation**: Use free platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn to share valuable content about your local market. You don't need a big budget to create engaging posts, videos, or blog content. Highlight local properties, share market trends, and showcase your expertise in the area.\n4. **Ask for Help**: Don’t hesitate to reach out to your network and ask for support. Whether it's past clients, friends, or family, let them know your situation and see if anyone is willing to lend a hand or make introductions. You might be surprised at how many people are willing to help when they understand your passion and struggle.\n5. **Maximize Free Tools**: Use free marketing and SEO tools like Google My Business, Moz, or HubSpot's free CRM. These can help you optimize your online presence without spending money.\n6. **Performance-Based Contracts**: When offering a performance-based contract, clearly define the goals and outcomes. Whether it's leads generated, social media growth, or closed sales, make sure both parties understand what success looks like and how compensation will work.\n\nRemember, resilience and creativity often come out of tough situations. By focusing on your strengths and building relationships, you can start to turn things around, even on a limited budget.",

Just joined this subreddit and would love some input :)\n\nSome background:\n\nI moved to Los Angeles in 2018 and worked at an Apple Store while finishing my undergraduate in Marketing. Graduated in ‘21. Quit my job last December after 7 years. Currently live in Guadalajara. I’m taking a year off while I decide my next career decisions. \n\nMy plan: \n\nMy aunt owns a successful coffee catering business in Los Angeles. She agreed to let me volunteer my time and do her marketing. I don’t feel as though my university prepared me enough for a marketing job. So, I’m thinking of teaching myself skills (maybe through Coursera or a similar platform) so that I can practice with her business. Once I gain enough skills, I will apply for a big-boy corporate job. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1. What concepts do you suggest I focus on learning that will help me nail a marketing job? \n2. Any skills you recommend to find a remote job?\n3. Any platforms your recommend to self-teach? Coursera, YouTube, etc.\n\nI appreciate your time and input. \nThanks y’all. 💕",

            "selftext": "Influencer marketing isn't the miracle cure everyone's selling you. But then why are there tons of blogs saying this is THE solution??\n\nThey're selling shovels in a gold rush 😓\n\nInfluencer platforms, management tools, analytics suites - it's a whole industry built on convincing you that you NEED influencers.\n\nInfluencer marketing is NOT right for everyone.\n\nHere's what you need to be prepared for before jumping into influencer marketing --\n\n**1— You should have achieved product-market fit:**\n\nIt means people actually want what you're selling. If your product sucks, influencers can't save you. They'll just amplify how much it sucks. Fix your product first. Then worry about influencers\n\n**2— You need to know your audience inside out:**\n\nKnow more than just the demographics. You should be able to describe your audience's interests, pain points, and online behavior in detail. You need to do this to know what kind of influencer you're looking for. Take the time to really understand who you're trying to reach.\n\n**3— There must be enough relevant influencers in your niche:**\n\nBefore investing in influencer marketing, spend time researching. Look through hashtags related to your industry and check out your competitors' social media. I often use getsaral platform to find influencers. If you can't find at least 30-50 potential influencers who align with your brand, you might not have a big enough pool to work with.\n\n**4— Be aware of potential legal risks:**\n\nSome industries have strict regulations about advertising. For example, health supplements and financial services often have specific rules about what claims can be made. If you're in a regulated industry, you'll need to closely monitor what influencers say about your product. This adds an extra layer of complexity and potential risk.\n\n**5— Prepare for the time suck:**\n\nInfluencer marketing is not just giving money to influencers to promote your products - you have to build relationships with influencers, talk to a lot of people, answer queries, give feedback, etc. If the thought of all this sounds like hell, stick to ads.\n\nWhat's your opinion? Seen any examples of brands doing influencer marketing even when it doesn't fit them?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gej9y9s3fbmd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=af5dacdceff66d374fb1b9fd4e5ee5ff0fe6d0cb\n\n",

They are testing the more straightforward \"win deals\" against the more tongue-in-cheek \"go nuts\" since their platform is literally named after a species of nut.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think they are both pretty great.

It doesn't talk about who should apply, or what's in it for the creator, and there's a long, boring form. No wonder they don't get any interest from their ideal influencer.\n\nI searched for good examples of an influencer program landing page and found Snif's. It's absolutely steal-worthy. Here's a breakdown for your influencer program:\n\n1. First impression: Their opening section talks about joining a community, not just promoting products. They clearly explain what influencers get and have a simple button to apply.\n2. How it works: They break down the process into 3 easy steps. This helps clear up any questions influencers might have, making them more likely to apply.\n3. Who they're looking for: They describe the type of influencers they want. It's not all about follower count - they care more about creativity and shared values.\n4. Future opportunities: They show how one influencer grew with the brand over time. This gives potential partners an idea of where the relationship could go.\n5. Extra benefits: They offer things like early access to products and special events. These perks make their program feel more special than just another paid gig.\n\nWhat stood out to me was how they're really trying to sell their program, not just list what they need.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oiez837tf0ld1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1fe70f25b49dc6490aa73f0923d7d0a87199ead\n\nPS: *I've detailed notes on each of the sections and how anyone can apply Snif's strategy.

Our emails were too generic, which led to poor open rates and minimal interaction with our feature updates and announcements.\n\n**What We Did:** We decided to overhaul our approach by using data-driven insights to personalize our emails. Instead of sending the same message to everyone, we started tailoring our content based on user behavior and how they interact with our platform. For example, we sent different updates to active users versus those who hadn't logged in recently, and included personalized tips based on their usage patterns. \n\n* For context, we export our **unlimited leads** from **WarpLeads**.\n\n**The Result:** This shift led to a noticeable 15% increase in open rates and better engagement with our updates. Users seemed more interested and involved with the content we were sharing.\n\n**My Question:** While we’re seeing better results, I’m curious—how do you handle segmenting your email lists to ensure you're reaching the right audience with the right message? Any specific strategies or tools that have worked well for you?\n\nLooking forward to your tips and insights!",

Though they don't seem to have high expectations, I do. I want to grow in this role.\n\nThey have hundreds of product listings in the construction/home renovation industry.\n\nI know this isn't a lot of info but what advice would you give me for growing as a professional and maximizing the impact of this position? Tips, resources, courses, influencers, etc.\n\nRemember I'm a rookie, so don't assume anything.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!",

That’s Marketing but learn from it and grow. \n\nSpeak with confidence when explaining your plans and goals. You may suffer from imposter syndrome but don’t let that take away from the things you know or believe will work. Same with your failures. Explain why it failed and how you’ll be able to learn from it and regroup. \n\nTake advantage of EVERY learning opportunity. Go to conventions, watch YouTube videos, take courses. See if your employer will help with the cost of some of these. I was shocked how willing my employer at the time was to pay for courses and other learning opportunities.",

My advice is to make connections and find a mentor. I've met with many many marketing directors and business owners to offer them help and run their campaigns and the biggest benefit they have found is having multiple connections in local media and marketing agencies to get help with new ideas and fulfillment. \n\nIf you have questions I'm happy to give out some advice and be a connection for you! Just message me!\n\nAlso one of my favorite categories to work with is home services/improvement so I can tell you how my clients have worked with me in that space if it helps.",

The biggest mistake I've made in my career earlier is pushing and trying to do everything myself but it doesn't have to be like that because then even the slightest criticism hits really hard since you feel VERY isolated. Also, speak with friends, colleagues or someone you who has been previously in a position like yours. \n\nAlso communicate. Like OVER communicate things. Make sure you're not sitting on information that should be shared and needs to be looped and give yourself room to learn and make mistakes. There's a reason you're in this position right now. Imposter syndrome might come and go but don't forget to give yourself credit where it's due.\n\nBest of luck!",
