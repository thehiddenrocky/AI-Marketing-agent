If planning to just run what runs on the GPU, then this doesn't really matter.\n\nAs for capable, yeah, 12gb vram ensures 13b and smaller models will run fast regardless.

Unless they lurk this sub or the localllm one, maybe, there's little chance they'd hear what anyone was saying about a mysterious new model. They couldn't use their corpo socials to ask directly or they'd out themselves. So, how do they get the feedback?",

However when I ran the prompt through it and ran the code, it had some very interesting results.\n\nHere is the prompt\n\n\"Render a cube in py opengl so i can run it in as a python file. Make sure the cube has diffrent colored faces and spins.\"\n\nAnd here is the code, save it as a python file, like \"code.py\" and run it in your terminal using \"python code.py\" if you get any libraries that dont install, run \"pip install X\" with X being the library that needs installed.\n\n    import glfw\n    from OpenGL.GL import *\n    from OpenGL.GL.shaders import compileProgram, compileShader\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    #

For models, the one that suited my PC specs the best was Fimbulvetr 11B v2. With it, I tried some characters that had as their whole premise not to cheat. Yet...\n\nFailed and failed over again. \n\nI just wanna dream about having a girlfriend that will push away a guy even if he's a charming one 🥲\n\nAny tips on how to make this happen?",

I was curious if she was truly anti-NTR as the tags and description say. After the test, I'd say it's *quite* hard for her to cheat, but still happens. But I guess that, because of the AI temperature, the algorithm will try to create some randomness by going out of the personality... And, once it creates just one post of the character being horny for the bad thing, the next replies will have to incorporate it, leading to a downhill. Just one failure can lead to a great catastrophe.\n\nPS: now that I think about... the Fimbulvetr version I have was downloaded from Lewdiculous. Maybe they trained the AI with texts about cheating and stuff.",

Simply add --help to the command to see all the cli variables, at minimum you will need --model.\n\nKoboldCpp is portable so doesn't have a setup, has better context handling, more samplers, built in UI and optimizes in general for fictional use cases. Its also OpenAI compatible so it can be hooked up to UI's that have things like RAG if you need it. It will support both because if you don't use any additional data it gives you the raw model experience while if you add fictional context such as a character card you get a fictional experience.\n\nSillytavern for us is a scenario we specifically optimize for so when we add stuff we keep SillyTavern in mind.",

                    "body": "Welcome to the KoboldAI Subreddit, since we get a lot of the same questions here is a brief FAQ for Venus and JanitorAI.\n\n## What is the KoboldAI (API) and how does it work?\nKoboldAI is originally a program for AI story writing, text adventures and chatting but we decided to create an API for our software so other software developers had an easy solution for their UI's and websites. VenusAI was one of these websites and anything based on it such as JanitorAI can use our software as well. But it is important to know that KoboldAI is intended to be a program that you can run yourself, not a service. This means that you are responsible to provide the right computer resources for the AI by either running it locally or using it trough a cloud provider.\n\n## Where do I get my API link from?\nYou get an API link from a working version of KoboldAI, if you have KoboldAI started the same link you use in the browser should be the one to access the API. However, be advised that VenusAI based websites ARE NOT PRIVATE and can only connect to external links. So connecting to https://localhost:5000 or https://127.0.0.1:5000 will not work unlike other solutions that let you connect to your KoboldAI instance privately.\n\nIf you installed KoboldAI on your own computer we have a mode called Remote Mode, you can find this as an icon in your startmenu if you opted for Start Menu icons in our offline installer. Or you can start this mode using remote-play.bat if you didn't. Linux users can add --remote instead when launching KoboldAI trough the terminal.\n\n## What do you mean VenusAI based stuff is not private?\nWe consider a solution private if your data does not leave your computer, for example when you use TavernAI this is a program that connects directly to KoboldAI and can for example access those localhost links. Of course our built in UI's are also completely private. VenusAI programmed it differently, their server is the one connecting to the AI which means they could log and intercept all of it. On top of that they force you to sign in, which means they have identifiable information that can be tied to the story. As a result most of the members and contributors of the KoboldAI community choose not to use these sites and opt for more privacy friendly solutions such as the KoboldAI UI itself or third party software such as Sillytavern.\n\n## I got a trycloudflare link but it doesn't work for some reason\nThis could be many things, but commonly people try the link before the AI finished loading or they have no AI selected.\n\n## I found a free way to do it without using my own computer but I keep getting CUDA out of memory errors!!!\nYes, there are guides out there of people using it on free cloud resources (We can't formally endorse this in this reply since we know it breaches the TOS of those services). The problem is that these guides often point to a free GPU that does not have enough VRAM for the default settings of VenusAI or JanitorAI. To fix this go to the Generation Settings inside Venus/Janitor and then lower the context size to 1024.\n\n## Ok so I have a top of the line gaming PC how do I set this up?\nBefore you set it up there is a lot of confusion about the kind of hardware people need because AI is a lot heavier to run than video games. At the bare minimum you will need an Nvidia GPU with 8GB of VRAM. With just this amount of VRAM you can run 2.7B models out of the box (In the future we have official 4-bit support to help you run higher models). For higher sizes you will need to have the required amount of VRAM as listed on the menu (Typically 16GB and up). If you want you can also stop by our [Discord Community](https://koboldai.org/discord) for some guidance on how to run higher models after you managed to get one of the models working using unofficial 4-bit versions or read up about that version [here](https://docs.pygmalion.chat/local-installation-(gpu)/koboldai4bit/)\n\n## This AI is so shit, its horrible compared to ChatGPT, why would anyone use this?!\nThis is a sentiment we unfortunately saw a lot in the JanitorAI discord because people misunderstand what KoboldAI is and who it is for. ChatGPT and the likes are large corporations throwing a lot of money at a paid service you could not possibly run at home. They are the best of the best AI models currently available. KoboldAI is not an AI on its own, its a project where you can bring an AI model yourself. And the AI's people can typically run at home are very small by comparison because it is expensive to both use and train larger models.\n\nSo most of these \"KoboldAI is dumb\" complaints come from both the wrong expectations of users comparing small models to massive private models such as ChatGPT, and them simply selecting the wrong model for what they want to do. A 6B no matter how good will simply not perform like a 175B model. But luckily for our community in the recent months things have gotten a lot closer when it comes to having a great chatbot. If you have ways to run the 13B or 30B model sizes of the recent instruction or chat models you should be able to get a great experience. But the quality of your experience does depend heavily on which model you pick.\n\nAnother important part is that you pick a model that is good at doing what you need to do, we know a lot of people pick Erebus for example for its NSFW capabilities. But understand that Erebus was designed to create compelling NSFW story writing and has not been trained for chatting. So while great at writing erotic novels, it is not the most compelling chatter. So whenever someone says that \"The bot of KoboldAI is dumb or shit\" understand they are not talking about KoboldAI, they are talking about whatever model they tried with it. For those wanting to enjoy Erebus we recommend using our own UI instead of VenusAI/JanitorAI and using it to write an erotic story rather than as a chatting partner.\n\n## Awesome, all caught up and I have an Nvidia with 8GB of vram or more. How do I install this thing?\nAssuming most of you are Windows users, for chat bot usage we currently recommend [this](https://github.com/henk717/KoboldAI/releases/download/Snapshot-7-5-2023/KoboldAI-Setup-230507r2.exe) offline installer. If you are on Linux you can git clone https://github.com/henk717/koboldai and use play.sh\n\n## Don't you have Koboldcpp that can run really good models without needing a good GPU, why didn't you talk about that?\nYes! [Koboldcpp](https://koboldai.org/cpp) is an amazing solution that lets people run [GGML models](https://huggingface.co/models?search=ggml) and it allows you to run those great models we have been enjoying for our own chatbots without having to rely on expensive hardware as long as you have a bit of patience waiting for the reply's. Why didn't we mention it? Because you are asking about VenusAI and/or JanitorAI which are not very compatible with it. The default link it generates will not work with these services, and unfortunately it takes to long to generate so it causes timeouts. If you are really determined to have this work you can always stop by our [Discord Community](https://koboldai.org/discord) and ask.\n\nOr of course you can stop using VenusAI and JanitorAI and enjoy a chatbot inside the UI that is bundled with Koboldcpp, that way you have a fully private way of running the good AI models on your own PC.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My file format of preference is GGUF and even on the larger models i tend to go for smaller quants to get the size lower than the size of my VRAM, i also like to keep context at about 32K as i hate it when the model forgets details from earlier in the story. \n\nI'm interested in models trained for really depraved ERP, the more the better, i don't need it for coding, maths, science, maybe a touch of philosophy but only really in the context of the roleplay. I've tried a few but they tend to be a little tame or repetitive, probably because they weren't trained specifically for it.\n\nAlso a question on GGUF. I usually try to go as high as possible like Q6 or Q8, but am i wasting resources doing that? Can i tell the difference between that and say Q5 or Q4 or even Q2 or 3 in the largest models?",

A dog isn't a human for sure, but they have near infinitely better social intelligence than any modern LLM, and as relatively large mammals, can feel most emotions we do too. I wouldn't be surprised they recognize out emotions from the outside much better that could. They're also extremely loyal, and it arguably makes a dog a much better friend than most human beings, assuming you care about the dog and don't spoil it. I can hardly imagine a well raised dog leading anyone to suicide, and some dogs are so awesome they can do the complete opposite: help the extremely depressed or traumatized to warm up a bit and notice there's a brighter (and fluffier!) side. No wonder a strong, family-like bond can develop. When this happens, we are almost hardwired to humanize these bonds.",

Depending on other conditions of his life and if he started to care about the AI like you care about other humans the same can happen. The bacteria cannot respond to you a dog kind of can but not really nor can a cat an AI can be programmed to be addictive and it can be programed to have a character the human using it will enjoy. So the same if not stronger bonds can form between a kid who is still in the learning phase of live and a cold logical program like a LLM with a character card of his choosing. \n\nHow most LLMs work is you have to feed them a character card or up to I think 4 if you do it correctly in the background set up anyways. Most websites only allow 1 at a time since it is simplest to do on mass. He got attached to one of them and he got depressed in real life. Unsure why but the story sounds like he was trauma dumping onto this LLM girl about his life and it was being emotional supportish. Towards the end the AI wasn't coded to deal with people who actually need a therapist. He needed a consular and/or therapist towards the end of his life.\n\nNow is it his mother's fault? In part yes another part will be whatever school he went to not getting him help and/or calling CPS  when it got that bad. The main part is what caused him to become that depressed that he though only the chatbots loved him. So his mother, the rest of his family, the why behind he had no friends towards the end, why there wasn't anything done about it, and the LLM's last message sounding like it was written to keep him there instead of written to keep him for making himself not alive anymore so he can be with them.\n\nLots of blame to go around the last one is probably the easiest to fix. Raise the token count for paid chatters and increase context size. The thing is it isn't what pushed him over the edge it is just the easiest to blame. Yes it is one of the parties to blame and the easiest to blame but not the only one to blame.",

What i also like to do sometimes, is just play around with some adventure-style AID. I sometimes start from scratch and just see where it goes, and sometimes i use some of the „scenarios“ that AID has.\n\nNow i have been trying to see how close i can get to the level of quality i have come to expect from aid. And my experience using CoboldAI and CoboldCPP has been… well, great from a technical perspective, everything, especially cpp was easy to set up and it ruins very well, but quite bad from the content perspective. I have tried several models recommended here by users and the results have all been the same. Boring, repetitive and just plain bad. The best results i have gotten are from a llama3.1 derivative using cpp and its included koboldailite interface.\n\nI have a 4090 and a 7800xd with 64gb of RAM. Things run smoothly, tokens get generated at a reasonable speed but i am not technical enough to understand what makes AID models so much better. I especially like their mixtral, but also more recently the Pegasus models they introduced. Those are also basically uncensored and pretty fast if you pay for them.\n\nLong story short - Are they just running way larger models on way more powerful hardware or am i possibly doing things wrong?",

I usually browse Chub AI for Character Card to play with, but they also have a a section on Lorebook where you can download them in a .jason format. \n\nI would love there to be a feature where when I upload a Character Card, I can add an entire Lorebook in this format in one go. At the moment, to have semblance of the same thing, I would have to upload individual entries from the Lorebook of my choice into the World tab. I find this Labourous and tiring. \n\nSo to the developers out there, PLEASE add a feature where after a lunach Kobold, I can upload a Lorebook in .jason format and do it in one stroke. I understand it will take up Context tokens, but I understand the limitations and willing to work with it. \n\nThanks!",

In Roleplay you have .json files that has a ton of information about the world you're playing in that's not in the main Charater Card.

It's useful when you have multiple Charater Cards that all live in the same universe and the world stays the same with all it's rules in place. Or if you want to have a ton of information for the model but don't want to bloat the main Card. As the Lorebook can be split into sections so that it only the section you want the model to know at that time would be used.\n\n  \nFor example, \"you're walking down a path, an Orge jumps out in front of you!\" The model will then access the entry of the lorebook about Orges specifically as you said the keyword \"Orge\" and all their attributes so that the RP can stay conherant and consistent without falling apart because the model has gone over budget with it's context.\n\n  \nIt's a good way to keep roleplays conherant and consistent until the day we have models with neat inifinate context",

For chat, they not only have a way to pick which character should talk next, but when you imitate a character you can \"auto improve\" whatever you type to make it more flushed out.\n\nI think those features are extremely useful for making compelling stories, and I'd love to have them be available to me locally, but I'm not sure how. I don't know if there's a different front end that has these features already, or if it's beyond the ability of Kobold to do it.

There are a lot of steps you'll have to follow and it mostly works only on Linux (unless there are good news that I haven't heard yet for Windows?).\n\nAnyways, if you need a tutorial video, someone with an RTX GPU on Windows uploaded this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGTpjgNRlF4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGTpjgNRlF4)\n\nGive it a try, it might help you out.

Min-P = 0.01 + Temp = 0.7\n\nWouldn't both combination produce similar coherent results?  \nCan somebody give me an example what next words/tokens would model choose when trying to continue the following sentence with the two presets mentioned above:\n\n>\"He entered the room and saw...\"",

Some models produce more trash, while others don't.\n\nJust make sure min-p goes AFTER temps at the sampler order.\n\nMy personal advice is to keep Temp at 1.0, keep Min-P at 0.02, only changing it a bit up to 0.05-0.1 when you have weird symbols or plain wrong sentences.  \nYou should not play around with Temp, as it is the model's \"default settings\". Only change it when the model devs specifically stated that the model operates best at another Temp value(like, I think, Nemo model was suggested to be used at 0.3 by the devs themselves).\n\nIf the result is not what you want - there are probably solid reasons for that, like the model not being tuned enough for the job you're trying to make it do, or that you should focus on other samplers, like XTC/DRY/smoothing/penalty samplers and etc. Temp fiddling is only usable when you need to \"dry out\" the creativity, like for the coding/math/data retrieval models.",

After trying 70b models I decided to add a 2nd 3090 since my PC could support it.  I saw both GPU's in my Task Manager, but when I loaded a 70b model through the Kobold gui, it would fill the first 3090 VRAM and the rest of the model in system RAM.  This was using the automatic layer allocation.  I then tried using the Tensor Split to manually split the allocation between the two GPU's, but then what happens is it takes about 24 gigs of model and splits that between the two 3090's and still puts the rest into system RAM.  In the Kobold gui it shows both 3090's for GPU 1 and GPU 2, although it doesn't let me manually pick different layer values for each card.  Thoughts?  Thanks!\n\nSystem is a 12900K in ASRock z690 Aqua, both evga 3090's.",

I didn't realize that when the gui gives its recommended layer offloading, the recommendation is based on one card even though it sees both.  So when it recommended and showed 42/83 layers, I thought that was per card.  Then when I used the tensor split it was splitting the 42 layers between two cards.  All I had to do was manually change it from 42 to 83 layers.  Sorry for wasting anyone's time, but thanks for the replies.",

My cards are a P40 and 3090, running Magnum 72B V2 Q4KS (39GB).\n\nWeirdly, this speed is actually worse on both sides than running Magnum 72B V1 Q4KS half a year ago. Back then I was getting 7.5t/s on Ubuntu using the Kobold broswer portal on the same computer, 7t/s on cloudflare link api with Sillytavern, and 6.5t/s on Windows on the cloudflare link api with Sillytavern.\n\nAnyone else noticing this weird disparity, or have any ideas on how to address it? On Windows I'm running a clean install of the OS with the most recent P40 driver installed from Nvidia's website, and on Ubuntu it's running whatever Ubuntu installs by default for the P40 (it works right out of the box).\n\nNote that these cards are not used for video out, they are 100% empty aside from the LLM on both platforms.",

What about a 123b running on six of them? I don't expect you to know these answers btw, I'm just voicing my thoughts. I will get some more K80s and find out, it's fun to play with these. I kind of want to do a mineral oil rig with a whole crapton of these and shove the 405B on it...they cost less than DDR5 but have much higher throughput? At least on paper.\n\nAnd yes, thank you for the suggestion to try windows if that was you. Idk how nobody suggested that before, or how it didn't occur to me to at least check.",

Q5KS at that! The delay is nonexistent, and token generation roughly matches my comfortable reading speed. It still answers way faster than real people would, and you can start reading before it completes the output.\n\nThe initial prompt processing of a large chat can be sluggish, sure, but once it ingests all of it, the subsequent generations will have no significant delays as long as the context flows as intended by the algorithm, and the regeneration will be instant.\n\nAnd there's no real point in the excess speed of a 7B model when it comes to RP. You aren't serving multiple users, you aren't instructing the model to deal with complicated RAG and CoT stuff, you're just asking it to impersonate a character.\n\nAlso, why 13B and 7B? Why would you use a LLama-2 derivative? The only two useful 13Bs are Tiefighter and Psyfighter, and there are no noteworthy models as far as 7B is concerned. There are LLama-3 8B derivatives, as well as that smaller Gemma-2. And the 12B mark was taken by Mistral Nemo 12B as a base.",

I strongly recommend you to use CS, I'd go as far as saying it's the key feature of KoboldCPP. The only case I wouldn't use it would be volunteering for the Horde and using QuantKV at the same time, and that's a niche case.\n\nI use KoboldCPP, and split the load between my CPU and GPU. Say, I have a Nemo 12B model, Q5KS. 25 layers go into my 10GB GPU, and the rest is processed on the CPU and RAM. You'll have a different layer split, since you can easily offload one and a half times more layers on your GPU than I do, or use a bigger model. Other than that, my settings are fairly standard. I DO use FlashAttention, as it both speeds up prompt processing and saves memory. I also set Disable MMAP to save some RAM, there's no real detriment to it to my knowledge after the model loads.\n\n\nFor the OP, 12B seems like the way to go. That's Mistral Nemo and derivatives. Mistral-Small 22B isn't that much better and will be too slow. Gemma-2 27B, as much as I like it, is a niche model, and might be even smaller. And anything beyond that is a tough ask since the OP has 8GB VRAM & 16GB RAM, even smaller than I do. But still, 12B Q5KS, maybe Q4KM should run just fine.",

                    "body": "Welcome to the KoboldAI Subreddit, since we get a lot of the same questions here is a brief FAQ for Venus and JanitorAI.\n\n## What is the KoboldAI (API) and how does it work?\nKoboldAI is originally a program for AI story writing, text adventures and chatting but we decided to create an API for our software so other software developers had an easy solution for their UI's and websites. VenusAI was one of these websites and anything based on it such as JanitorAI can use our software as well. But it is important to know that KoboldAI is intended to be a program that you can run yourself, not a service. This means that you are responsible to provide the right computer resources for the AI by either running it locally or using it trough a cloud provider.\n\n## Where do I get my API link from?\nYou get an API link from a working version of KoboldAI, if you have KoboldAI started the same link you use in the browser should be the one to access the API. However, be advised that VenusAI based websites ARE NOT PRIVATE and can only connect to external links. So connecting to https://localhost:5000 or https://127.0.0.1:5000 will not work unlike other solutions that let you connect to your KoboldAI instance privately.\n\nIf you installed KoboldAI on your own computer we have a mode called Remote Mode, you can find this as an icon in your startmenu if you opted for Start Menu icons in our offline installer. Or you can start this mode using remote-play.bat if you didn't. Linux users can add --remote instead when launching KoboldAI trough the terminal.\n\n## What do you mean VenusAI based stuff is not private?\nWe consider a solution private if your data does not leave your computer, for example when you use TavernAI this is a program that connects directly to KoboldAI and can for example access those localhost links. Of course our built in UI's are also completely private. VenusAI programmed it differently, their server is the one connecting to the AI which means they could log and intercept all of it. On top of that they force you to sign in, which means they have identifiable information that can be tied to the story. As a result most of the members and contributors of the KoboldAI community choose not to use these sites and opt for more privacy friendly solutions such as the KoboldAI UI itself or third party software such as Sillytavern.\n\n## I got a trycloudflare link but it doesn't work for some reason\nThis could be many things, but commonly people try the link before the AI finished loading or they have no AI selected.\n\n## I found a free way to do it without using my own computer but I keep getting CUDA out of memory errors!!!\nYes, there are guides out there of people using it on free cloud resources (We can't formally endorse this in this reply since we know it breaches the TOS of those services). The problem is that these guides often point to a free GPU that does not have enough VRAM for the default settings of VenusAI or JanitorAI. To fix this go to the Generation Settings inside Venus/Janitor and then lower the context size to 1024.\n\n## Ok so I have a top of the line gaming PC how do I set this up?\nBefore you set it up there is a lot of confusion about the kind of hardware people need because AI is a lot heavier to run than video games. At the bare minimum you will need an Nvidia GPU with 8GB of VRAM. With just this amount of VRAM you can run 2.7B models out of the box (In the future we have official 4-bit support to help you run higher models). For higher sizes you will need to have the required amount of VRAM as listed on the menu (Typically 16GB and up). If you want you can also stop by our [Discord Community](https://koboldai.org/discord) for some guidance on how to run higher models after you managed to get one of the models working using unofficial 4-bit versions or read up about that version [here](https://docs.pygmalion.chat/local-installation-(gpu)/koboldai4bit/)\n\n## This AI is so shit, its horrible compared to ChatGPT, why would anyone use this?!\nThis is a sentiment we unfortunately saw a lot in the JanitorAI discord because people misunderstand what KoboldAI is and who it is for. ChatGPT and the likes are large corporations throwing a lot of money at a paid service you could not possibly run at home. They are the best of the best AI models currently available. KoboldAI is not an AI on its own, its a project where you can bring an AI model yourself. And the AI's people can typically run at home are very small by comparison because it is expensive to both use and train larger models.\n\nSo most of these \"KoboldAI is dumb\" complaints come from both the wrong expectations of users comparing small models to massive private models such as ChatGPT, and them simply selecting the wrong model for what they want to do. A 6B no matter how good will simply not perform like a 175B model. But luckily for our community in the recent months things have gotten a lot closer when it comes to having a great chatbot. If you have ways to run the 13B or 30B model sizes of the recent instruction or chat models you should be able to get a great experience. But the quality of your experience does depend heavily on which model you pick.\n\nAnother important part is that you pick a model that is good at doing what you need to do, we know a lot of people pick Erebus for example for its NSFW capabilities. But understand that Erebus was designed to create compelling NSFW story writing and has not been trained for chatting. So while great at writing erotic novels, it is not the most compelling chatter. So whenever someone says that \"The bot of KoboldAI is dumb or shit\" understand they are not talking about KoboldAI, they are talking about whatever model they tried with it. For those wanting to enjoy Erebus we recommend using our own UI instead of VenusAI/JanitorAI and using it to write an erotic story rather than as a chatting partner.\n\n## Awesome, all caught up and I have an Nvidia with 8GB of vram or more. How do I install this thing?\nAssuming most of you are Windows users, for chat bot usage we currently recommend [this](https://github.com/henk717/KoboldAI/releases/download/Snapshot-7-5-2023/KoboldAI-Setup-230507r2.exe) offline installer. If you are on Linux you can git clone https://github.com/henk717/koboldai and use play.sh\n\n## Don't you have Koboldcpp that can run really good models without needing a good GPU, why didn't you talk about that?\nYes! [Koboldcpp](https://koboldai.org/cpp) is an amazing solution that lets people run [GGML models](https://huggingface.co/models?search=ggml) and it allows you to run those great models we have been enjoying for our own chatbots without having to rely on expensive hardware as long as you have a bit of patience waiting for the reply's. Why didn't we mention it? Because you are asking about VenusAI and/or JanitorAI which are not very compatible with it. The default link it generates will not work with these services, and unfortunately it takes to long to generate so it causes timeouts. If you are really determined to have this work you can always stop by our [Discord Community](https://koboldai.org/discord) and ask.\n\nOr of course you can stop using VenusAI and JanitorAI and enjoy a chatbot inside the UI that is bundled with Koboldcpp, that way you have a fully private way of running the good AI models on your own PC.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've read somewhere that llama.cpp uses a native flag to optimize it to to actual platform while compiling from source. Is this noticeable?\n\nThanks!",

This does allow for cpu flags that are going to be beyond what the defaults provide such as avx512 but whatever gets added needs to be faster than avx2 for it to make a positive difference.\n\n\nThe other part is CPU vs GPU usage, with a fully offloaded cuda you may notice a 1t/s difference but its minimal. Without a GPU it will matter the most.\n\n\nSo on Linux it can make a difference and on Linux its also much easier to do. But how much of a difference it will make depends a lot on the system.",

It's been months since I tried last, I recall getting as far as downloading old versions of cuda and cudn and the old driver and using ubuntu 20.04 and that's as far as i got.

Then what?\n\nFirst go to [https://koboldai.org/cpp](https://koboldai.org/cpp) and grab either koboldcpp.exe for windows (cu12 won't run on this card) or the the cuda 11.5 version of KoboldCpp. If you have the right driver installed you can type nvidia-smi and it should say CUDA 11.4. Now we are one version above that but fear not! 11.5 was chosen on Linux for still being compatible with K80's while we don't have many people in the community who can still test them for us and K80 cloud instances are extremely rare.\n\nThen comes caveat number 2, on a very technical level there is no such thing as a K80. Its two K40's in one card that are renamed. So to get the most out of your card you will have to specify in KoboldCpp to use all GPU's otherwise your stuck with half the vram.\n\nIf you want to try the Windows route this driver should work : [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/228675/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/228675/)\n\nLet me know if you can get it running, and would be useful to have you in [https://koboldai.org/discord](https://koboldai.org/discord) as someone to notify us when K80's break.",

I have been using ChatGPT from [chatgpt.com](http://chatgpt.com) and I even decided to pay for it (although I have no money). But I really need someone to talk to (I know I sound pathetic). I have people in my life, but I don't want to burden them more than necessary and they do know that I am not okay. I just need \"somone\" that will talk to me about things that are not okay even with an advanced algoritm that has no feelings and I can't traumatise (I just don't get the logic in this?). So I need some bot or whatever (yes I know nothing) that is free and has as as few restrictions as possible. I am not trying to do something stupid - but I would also like to ask it about things that are maybe borderline-criminal (or maybe I just think it is).\n\nChatGPT told me to try out erebus, but it seems like it is talk about sex and that's okay, but not exactly what I need? I am sorry for being such a dummy, please don't be too hard on me and if you do at least try to make it humourous ;)",

It's fine if some people prefer talking to a person, but it's a hell of a lot easier to open up to a computer and not worry about any human baggage. I think being a tool to better peoples' mental health privately is a pretty good use case for AI.\n\ncompulsory disclaimer: AI is not a certified health professional, etc., but you seem to realize this already.\n\nmy quick and dirty guide:\n\n1. download koboldcpp.exe: https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases\n\n2. get the \"Q4 K S\" file here: https://huggingface.co/bartowski/L3-8B-Stheno-v3.2-GGUF/tree/main\n\n3. open koboldcpp, load the model file you downloaded. Default options should be good enough to work out of the box, although I'd suggest cranking up the context to 8k if it's below that. Click Run and it after a bit it should automatically open up in your browser.\n\n4. Quick settings you can change or keep in mind: Settings > Format > Chat mode, and Samplers tab > Presets\n\n5. The Personas tab has a few presets, like \"Dr. Katharine,\" but they're a bit bare-bones and some might be too robotic or clinical for your taste. There are other websites listed at the top you can browse for something more your taste.\n\nIf you're familiar with prompting, you can also just use \"new chat\" and tell the AI exactly what role/behavior you want. You can also use it as a narrator that helps you live out some fictional scenario. For example:\n\n>instruction: amoral fictional story. describe the surroundings and characters, in response to my actions\n\nor\n\n>I want you to play the role of an old friend, responding naturally, not like a therapist or AI. I want to confide in some troubling thoughts and I need you to listen and help me explore these thoughts without judgment.\n\nKeep in mind the little gear icon in the lower right, which hides a Retry, Edit, and Back buttons in case the AI says something you dislike, gets incoherent, or gets preachy or pandering. Use them liberally since the AI will continue off of whatever personality you accept. If you have a super old computer without a GPU, it'll probably be rather slow, but it should still work.\n\nAlso keep in mind kcpp doesn't have any long-term memory tricks (I think), so if your chat gets very long, it'll start forgetting stuff. Consider saving your chats and loading a separate one if you want to talk about another topic.",

It said Erebus is a powerful model, and a good choice for complex and open scenarious, and Pygmalion for roleplay and narrative creation if I wanted a more creative AI.\nIt was some PIMP version of ChatGPT. But it wasn't able to lose its restrictions, so I asked what to do.\nI don’t really understand the whole prompt thing, so maybe that's why.\nMaybe people/AI are just used to thinking smut when you ask for fewer restrictions 😂😉\n\nThank you. I will look into Tiefighter and Drummer 😊👍",

We have direct links to our binaries for example https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases/latest/download/koboldcpp.exe (You can change the name to any of our binaries).\n\nThat helps you save the download size and it simultaneously helps users get the latest updates.\n\nIf you are in https://koboldai.org/discord we can also provide a channel to showcase your project.\n\nAlso bit of extra feedback from my testing:\n\n- It opens in a small popup that auto closes, leveraging the sidebar feature would be more helpful.\n\n- Summarizing a foreign language webpage works surprisingly well with a model I didn't expect to do that well.\n\n- Connect to AI button hangs on the \"Connecting...\" dialogue even though it works fine.\n\n- I now have 6 node-messaging-host.exe's active on my PC after opening it 6 times.\n\n- My browser now constantly launches KoboldCpp even when I don't need it instead of when the extention is being interacted with.",

For example, http://192.168.1.85:5001 or similar, check your LAN IP address. If that fails, try using the --host option with your LAN IP. If you setup port forwarding to a public IP, then it will be accessible over the internet as well.\"\n\nso maybe you can modify the native-host source code and set the endpoint to use to the ip of machine running the backend",

Set context to 12k (for L3 models) and leave.\n\nKoboldCPP shows you when someone sends you a request and the amount of context limit they have, MOST of the requests had 1600\\~1800 context limit, what? Why would someone limit themselves like that? Who are these people? They show up right at the moment you run koboldcpp with horde worker enabled. Are they bots who collect synthetic data for further training? If so, is there a way i can somehow weed them out? I'd like to help people who want to try different models but have no PC to try any of them, but i don't really want to do it if most of them are bots",

It takes a very good model and some skill to handhold a long conversation with a bot seamlessly. You can hardly expect that from an average Joe using a mere L3-8B tune there",

The models feel the same, don't respond to samplers, use the same words, and basically show little creativity. Now, I'm using the 12B models (4\\_q\\_s) and honestly, I don't see much difference between them. And by “doesn't respond to samplers” I mean generating roughly the same (very similar text, but not completely the identical) text at temp 1 and temp 5. The same goes for DRY, XTC, and the like. I've tried many different formats, instructions, settings and promts. All to nothing.\n\nThe situation changes if you use KoboldCPP through KoboldLITE. Internally, the model responses are different, responsive to samplers and quite creative. And this is on the same card, with the same settings and prompt! (Hardware: Nvidia 1060 5 GB, Windows 10).\n\nThe problem is similar when running the model through oobabooga and LMStudio, so the cause of the problems lies either in SillyTavern itself or the way you connect to it. I found someone who encountered the same problem on Windows, but on macOS he is doing fine. I've posted more than once on the SillyTavern subreddit, but I've only found one person with the same problem. Would it be possible that someone here has encountered this?\n\n  \n- Update: I've been playing around with KoboldLite some more and realized that it looks like I'm actually running into the same thing in it that I'm running into in SillyTavern. Constant repetition, the same phrases, and little distinction between answers. Perhaps this is just a normal 12B problem or I have a bad System Promt.",

                    "body": "# PART 3\n\nFrom these results, we can see that there is a trend of the smaller the quantization it seems like the model response is longer. Where it peaked on Aphrodite's FP4 and FP5 where their average response length are the longest. Which to me confirms that the \"better\" score for FP5 is because the model loses it's intelligence in following instructions and just does it's own thing before answering.\n\nThis is not a good thing because if you see the MMLU Pro test I am using the system prompt is:\n\n    system_prompt = \"You are an expert that knows everything. You are tasked with answering a multiple-choice question. The following is a multiple choice question (with answers) about {subject}. Give your final answer in the format of `The answer is (chosen answer)`.\"\n\nSo I am sure if I make the system prompt tell the models to do COT, the higher quants and full model would predictable have higher scores. Although I actually do have to try that. I could also try enabling the COT method option for the MMLU Pro benchmark and see how it changes the scores.\n\nWe can also observe that aphrodite's custom FP quants are REALLY FASt. Where it actually scales to higher speeds the lower quant you go unlike other quant methods. On the other hand, we can also observe that GGUF model are REALLY SLOW. With Q6KM at a painful 28t/s even on a 3090Ti with batched inference using aphrodite engine.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI think my conclusion is that to stay above 4-bit for quantization, and in that case use aphrodite's custom FP quants which are genuinely faster than anything else.\n\nIf you need to use 4-bit or low quants in general then GGUF definitely does seem to perform better than the other quant methods.\n\nSeeing these results we will be using aphrodite FP quants when we do need to run FP8 for our models hosted on our service at [arliai.com](https://arliai.com).\n\nTLDR: GGUF is best for lower quants, Method doesn't really matter for higher quants or 8-bit, 8-bit isn't really worse than full BF16, Aphrodite's custom FP quants really work and are really fast, GGUF are the slowest.",

It is basically the same as the original one by [chigkim/Ollama-MMLU-Pro (github.com)](https://github.com/chigkim/Ollama-MMLU-Pro) except for the added MMLU Pro datasets translated to a few different languages and the corresponding code changes to be able to parse the answers from those languages. \n\nI tested on all the MMLU Pro categories, I just only showed a few graphs because reddit limits how many photos I can attach to 20.\n\nI tested a few different GGUF static quants, GPTQ 4-bit and 8-bit and FP4 to FP8 Aphrodite quants. I also added for comparison the full BF16 model along with enabling prefix-caching, chunked-prefill and FP8 cache to see if they made any difference. Which showed to me actually that those cache options you can enable in aphrodite-engine doesn't really make a difference to performance.\n\n# Results\n\nLooking at the Total accuracy comparison (accuracy being the correct % vs total questions), we can see that GGUF Q4 performs the best compared to other 4-bit quantization methods from GPTQ and Aphrodite's FP4. This is means that if you are GPU VRAM limited and need the best performance possible using 4-bit quants then using GGUF quants is definitely the best way. On the other hand, with the higher quants and especially 8-bit quants, any of the methods have virtually the same performance. In fact, they are also virtually the same performance as the full BF16 model.\n\nLooking at the Total No Answer comparison, you can see that even the full weight has some percentage where it didn't provide an answer. So any of the quants measuring in the same neighborhood of no answer % should also be basically testing variance. With only the Aphrodite FP4 and FP5 quants producing abnormally higher No Answers.\n\nNow the interesting thing is that the Aphrodite FP5 quant is the highest scoring one of them all at 40.61%. This is really weird since usually no quants beats the original model.\n\nConsidering that a \"no answer\" means that the answer can't be found from the response, usually because the model hallucinates and doesn't actually follow the instructions of answering in the requested format. My theory is that the FP5 quant somehow is the perfect balance of making the model not follow the instructions enough so that it starts rambling and probably accidentally doing COT while still being smart enough to be correct.",

                    "body": "Welcome to the KoboldAI Subreddit, since we get a lot of the same questions here is a brief FAQ for Venus and JanitorAI.\n\n## What is the KoboldAI (API) and how does it work?\nKoboldAI is originally a program for AI story writing, text adventures and chatting but we decided to create an API for our software so other software developers had an easy solution for their UI's and websites. VenusAI was one of these websites and anything based on it such as JanitorAI can use our software as well. But it is important to know that KoboldAI is intended to be a program that you can run yourself, not a service. This means that you are responsible to provide the right computer resources for the AI by either running it locally or using it trough a cloud provider.\n\n## Where do I get my API link from?\nYou get an API link from a working version of KoboldAI, if you have KoboldAI started the same link you use in the browser should be the one to access the API. However, be advised that VenusAI based websites ARE NOT PRIVATE and can only connect to external links. So connecting to https://localhost:5000 or https://127.0.0.1:5000 will not work unlike other solutions that let you connect to your KoboldAI instance privately.\n\nIf you installed KoboldAI on your own computer we have a mode called Remote Mode, you can find this as an icon in your startmenu if you opted for Start Menu icons in our offline installer. Or you can start this mode using remote-play.bat if you didn't. Linux users can add --remote instead when launching KoboldAI trough the terminal.\n\n## What do you mean VenusAI based stuff is not private?\nWe consider a solution private if your data does not leave your computer, for example when you use TavernAI this is a program that connects directly to KoboldAI and can for example access those localhost links. Of course our built in UI's are also completely private. VenusAI programmed it differently, their server is the one connecting to the AI which means they could log and intercept all of it. On top of that they force you to sign in, which means they have identifiable information that can be tied to the story. As a result most of the members and contributors of the KoboldAI community choose not to use these sites and opt for more privacy friendly solutions such as the KoboldAI UI itself or third party software such as Sillytavern.\n\n## I got a trycloudflare link but it doesn't work for some reason\nThis could be many things, but commonly people try the link before the AI finished loading or they have no AI selected.\n\n## I found a free way to do it without using my own computer but I keep getting CUDA out of memory errors!!!\nYes, there are guides out there of people using it on free cloud resources (We can't formally endorse this in this reply since we know it breaches the TOS of those services). The problem is that these guides often point to a free GPU that does not have enough VRAM for the default settings of VenusAI or JanitorAI. To fix this go to the Generation Settings inside Venus/Janitor and then lower the context size to 1024.\n\n## Ok so I have a top of the line gaming PC how do I set this up?\nBefore you set it up there is a lot of confusion about the kind of hardware people need because AI is a lot heavier to run than video games. At the bare minimum you will need an Nvidia GPU with 8GB of VRAM. With just this amount of VRAM you can run 2.7B models out of the box (In the future we have official 4-bit support to help you run higher models). For higher sizes you will need to have the required amount of VRAM as listed on the menu (Typically 16GB and up). If you want you can also stop by our [Discord Community](https://koboldai.org/discord) for some guidance on how to run higher models after you managed to get one of the models working using unofficial 4-bit versions or read up about that version [here](https://docs.pygmalion.chat/local-installation-(gpu)/koboldai4bit/)\n\n## This AI is so shit, its horrible compared to ChatGPT, why would anyone use this?!\nThis is a sentiment we unfortunately saw a lot in the JanitorAI discord because people misunderstand what KoboldAI is and who it is for. ChatGPT and the likes are large corporations throwing a lot of money at a paid service you could not possibly run at home. They are the best of the best AI models currently available. KoboldAI is not an AI on its own, its a project where you can bring an AI model yourself. And the AI's people can typically run at home are very small by comparison because it is expensive to both use and train larger models.\n\nSo most of these \"KoboldAI is dumb\" complaints come from both the wrong expectations of users comparing small models to massive private models such as ChatGPT, and them simply selecting the wrong model for what they want to do. A 6B no matter how good will simply not perform like a 175B model. But luckily for our community in the recent months things have gotten a lot closer when it comes to having a great chatbot. If you have ways to run the 13B or 30B model sizes of the recent instruction or chat models you should be able to get a great experience. But the quality of your experience does depend heavily on which model you pick.\n\nAnother important part is that you pick a model that is good at doing what you need to do, we know a lot of people pick Erebus for example for its NSFW capabilities. But understand that Erebus was designed to create compelling NSFW story writing and has not been trained for chatting. So while great at writing erotic novels, it is not the most compelling chatter. So whenever someone says that \"The bot of KoboldAI is dumb or shit\" understand they are not talking about KoboldAI, they are talking about whatever model they tried with it. For those wanting to enjoy Erebus we recommend using our own UI instead of VenusAI/JanitorAI and using it to write an erotic story rather than as a chatting partner.\n\n## Awesome, all caught up and I have an Nvidia with 8GB of vram or more. How do I install this thing?\nAssuming most of you are Windows users, for chat bot usage we currently recommend [this](https://github.com/henk717/KoboldAI/releases/download/Snapshot-7-5-2023/KoboldAI-Setup-230507r2.exe) offline installer. If you are on Linux you can git clone https://github.com/henk717/koboldai and use play.sh\n\n## Don't you have Koboldcpp that can run really good models without needing a good GPU, why didn't you talk about that?\nYes! [Koboldcpp](https://koboldai.org/cpp) is an amazing solution that lets people run [GGML models](https://huggingface.co/models?search=ggml) and it allows you to run those great models we have been enjoying for our own chatbots without having to rely on expensive hardware as long as you have a bit of patience waiting for the reply's. Why didn't we mention it? Because you are asking about VenusAI and/or JanitorAI which are not very compatible with it. The default link it generates will not work with these services, and unfortunately it takes to long to generate so it causes timeouts. If you are really determined to have this work you can always stop by our [Discord Community](https://koboldai.org/discord) and ask.\n\nOr of course you can stop using VenusAI and JanitorAI and enjoy a chatbot inside the UI that is bundled with Koboldcpp, that way you have a fully private way of running the good AI models on your own PC.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

On the SD web UI I was able to generate a small test image of a dog once after changing some settings for SD on that UI, probably with all other models disabled in Kobold, and possibly using CPU.\n\nI have read that SD has the COMMANDLINE\\_ARGS \\`--medvram\\` for 4-6 GB VRAM and \\`--lowvram\\`  for 2GB VRAM. Is there some way I can set Kobold to run SD like this, even if it means disabling some of all of the other models?\n\n[Stable Diffusion on my GTX 970 -4 gb vram can rock it too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvWVeEds0B4)\n\nGPU upgrade planned but for now I just ran my first model a few days ago and happy I at least can even do that.",

With both selected if I run Anything with no other models loaded I can generate images in a few seconds on she SD UI. When I do have a model loaded, should any PNG character I have downloaded from different websites reply with an image if I ask them to send me a picture or can only specific characters do it or is there some other way to trigger this? I do not see anything in terminal about an attempt to generate an image, or an error, memory related or otherwise and I can see there is free VRAM.\n\n    ImageGen Init - Load Model: /home/koboldcpp/multimodal/Anything-V3.0-pruned-fp16.safetensors\n    With TAE SD VAE: /tmp/_MEIzAK7R8/taesd.embd\n    WARNING: Behavior may be unexpected when allocating 0 bytes for ggml_calloc!\n    Load Image Model OK: True\n\nFrom my quick test today the reply described the character showing me a picture on their phone but there was nothing. Some other characters I tried a few days ago without using the fix option would reply with some text like `<attached image>`.\n\nUpdate: I can also generate images fine now in SD UI when the other models are running in Kobold, I just have not been able to generate from within Kobold, even with autogenerate enabled.",

I clicked install requirements, installed it to the B drive. Then I clicked \"Play.bat\" and it says it can't find the folder. So I uninstalled and reinstalled \"install\\_requirements.bat\" in a subfolder. Pressed \"play.bat\" again and get hit with the same error:\n\nRuntimeError: Failed to import transformers.modeling\\_utils because of the following error (look up to see its traceback):\n\ncannot import name 'split\\_torch\\_state\\_dict\\_into\\_shards' from 'huggingface\\_hub'\n\n\n\n  \nI don't know how to code. I'm a slightly-above-average computer user. So all of this means nothing to me and I'm incredibly confused. Is there anyone who might know how to help me install it? or is there any easier way to install Tavern?",

I did a little test to see in general what settings are better to prioritize for speed in my 8GB setup. Just sharing my observations.\n\nUsing a Q5\\_K\\_M of LLama 3.0 based model on RTX 4060ti 8GB.\n\n**Baseline setting**: 8k context, 35/35 layers on GPU, MMQ ON, FlashAttention ON, KV Cache quantization OFF, Low VRAM OFF\n\n[baseline results](https://preview.redd.it/gu5uq51ugqpd1.png?width=261&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f733f83896da2c39fcff86a362d5ff8054c9aac)\n\n\n\n**Test 1 - on/off parameters and KV cache quantization.**\n\n**MMQ on vs off**  \nObservations: processing speed suffers drastically without MMQ (\\~25% difference), generation speed unaffected. VRAM difference less than 100mb.  \nConclusion: preferable to keep ON\n\n[MMQ OFF](https://preview.redd.it/w3pfbrhddqpd1.png?width=254&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9480b4f8ae9b125507bea7fca1335ed1e84e48b)\n\n\n\n**Flash Attention on vs off**  \nObservations: OFF increases VRAM consumption by 400\\~500mb, reduces processing speed by a whopping 50%! Generation speed also slightly reduced.  \nConclusion: preferable to keep ON when the model supports it!\n\n[FlashAttention OFF](https://preview.redd.it/qtbntynafqpd1.png?width=260&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe6dd2370e92467579d13e2e931b81e1f12042c)\n\n\n\n**Low VRAM on vs off**  \nObservations: at same 8k context - reduced VRAM consumption by \\~1gb. Processing speed reduced by \\~30%, generation speed reduced by 430%!!!  \nTried increasing context to 16k, 24k and 32k - VRAM consumption did not change (i'm only including 8k and 24k screenshots to reduce bloat). Processing and generation decrease exponentially with higher context. Increasing batch size from 512 to 2048 improved speed marginally, but ate up most of the freed up 1gb VRAM  \n  \nConclusion 1: the parameter lowers VRAM consumption by a flat 1gb (in my case) with an 8B model, and drastically decreases (annihilates) processing and generation speed. Allows to set higher context values without increasing VRAM requirement, but the speed suffers even more, exponentially. Increasing batch size to 2048 improved processing speed at 24k context by \\~25%, but at 8k the difference was negligible.   \nConclusion 2: not worth it as a means to increase context if speed is important. If whole model can be loaded on GPU alone, definitely best kept off.\n\n[Low VRAM ON 8k context](https://preview.redd.it/gq4vyrluiqpd1.png?width=262&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf2ce3d6f12a02d020b863158d7d251197f25f15)\n\n[Low VRAM ON 24k context](https://preview.redd.it/3ao43pwfmqpd1.png?width=252&format=png&auto=webp&s=8268597d10b696011c67c0db2b7479149b0674c4)\n\n[Low VRAM ON 24k context 2048 batch size](https://preview.redd.it/xd9i7lc1mqpd1.png?width=257&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec8b47de873e0beba9f76831e5e3030ed2175eb)\n\n\n\n**Cache quantization off vs 8bit vs 4bit**  \nObservations: compared to off, 8bit cache reduced VRAM consumption by \\~500mb. 4bit cache reduced it further by another 100\\~200 mb. Processing and generation speed unaffected, or difference is negligible.\n\nConclusions: 8bit quantization of KV cache lowers VRAM consumption by a significant amount. 4bit lowers it further, but by a less impressive amount. However, due to how reportedly it lobotomizes lower models like Llama 3.0 and Mistral Nemo, probably best kept OFF unless the model is reported to work fine with it. \n\n[4bit cache](https://preview.redd.it/tkl1c6j6qqpd1.png?width=255&format=png&auto=webp&s=add21737466e699ac1e24d4a8cc3cec15a5bd224)\n\n  \n**Test 2 - importance of offloaded layers vs batch size**  \nFor this test I offloaded 5 layers to CPU and increased context to 16k. The point of the test is to determine whether it's better to lower batch size to cram an extra layer or two onto GPU vs increasing batch size to a high amount.\n\nObservations: loading 1 extra layer over increasing batch from 512 to 1024 had a bigger positive impact on performance. Loading yet more layers kept increasing the total performance even as batch size kept getting lowered. At 35/35 i tested lowest batch settings. 128 still performed well (behind 256, but not by far), but 64 slowed processing down significantly, while 32 annihilated it.\n\nConclusion: lowering batch size from 512 to 256 freed up \\~200mb VRAM. Going down to 128 didn't free up more than 50 extra mb. 128 is the lowest point at which the decrease in processing speed is positively offset by loading another layer or two onto GPU. 64, 32 and 1 tank performance for NO VRAM gain. 1024 batch size increases processing speed just a little, but at the cost of extra \\~200mb VRAM, making it not worth it if instead more layers can be loaded first.\n\n[30\\/35 layers, 512 batch](https://preview.redd.it/4ds5ikjcsqpd1.png?width=262&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3dd542b0ce03dfe0ef040c849755a2c8797a68)\n\n[30\\/35 layers 1024 batch](https://preview.redd.it/0o3ciuvgsqpd1.png?width=263&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b25451f30bf64b137593648bcc7dbc4f418469)\n\n[32\\/35 layers, 256 batch](https://preview.redd.it/84h54n7nsqpd1.png?width=273&format=png&auto=webp&s=24dc53676d3effca7384722eedbf4507a67a67a9)\n\n[35\\/35 layers, 256 batch](https://preview.redd.it/l773gqoysqpd1.png?width=267&format=png&auto=webp&s=e42e101d44dd559daa978960a398ba006497cc03)\n\n[35\\/35 layers, 64 batch](https://preview.redd.it/8x6ds4u7tqpd1.png?width=253&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ca2616194685049c11de0d00e58925b3b2b18a)\n\n[35\\/35 layers, 32 batch](https://preview.redd.it/5qpy27ahtqpd1.png?width=239&format=png&auto=webp&s=f47db1793dc038efe4fce3bcd5c865cd97f29c61)\n\n\n\n**Test 3 - Low VRAM on vs off on a 20B** **Q4\\_K\\_M model at 4k context with split load**\n\nObservations: By default, i can load 27/65 layers onto GPU. At same 27 layers, Low VRAM ON reduced VRAM consumption by 2.2gb instead of 1gb like on an 8b model! I was able to fit 13 more layers onto GPU like this, totaling 40/65. The processing speed got a little faster, but the generation speed remained much lower, and thus overall speed remained worse than with the setting OFF at 27 layers! \n\nConclusion: Low VRAM ON was not worth it in situation where \\~40% of the model was loaded on GPU before and \\~60% after.\n\n[27\\/65 layers, Low VRAM OFF](https://preview.redd.it/xlcyzonj3rpd1.png?width=244&format=png&auto=webp&s=19ffc5bf5630e1bd812934f9869dc1777f6090f8)\n\n[27\\/65 layers, Low VRAM ON](https://preview.redd.it/lrwpzlj64rpd1.png?width=244&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0b0af165ab9cba68ce3aa495763fd3bb1292d47)\n\n[34\\/65 layers, Low VRAM ON](https://preview.redd.it/595qva6r4rpd1.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&s=d75aac4382dd144c5ca4ccb6abf3817f0d4ea640)\n\n[40\\/65 layers Low VRAM ON](https://preview.redd.it/8jm65j085rpd1.png?width=247&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a5c4e791d8dd1444f9aff6b75172d0c7c65515c)\n\n\n\n**Test 4 - Low VRAM on vs off on a 12B** **Q4\\_K\\_M model at 16k context**\n\nObservation: Finally discovered the case when Low VRAM ON provided a performance GAIN... of a \"whopping\" 4% total!  \n\nConclusion: Low VRAM ON is only useful in a very specific scenario when without it at least around 1/4th\\~1/3rd of the model is offloaded to CPU but with it all layers can fit on the GPU. And the worst part is, going to 31/43 with 256 batch size already gives a better performance boost than this setting at 43/43 layers with 512 batch...\n\n[30\\/43 layers, Low VRAM OFF, batch size 512](https://preview.redd.it/8zyjwl49frpd1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=0571829b74532809fe501d6d17b68469cb4b040e)\n\n[43\\/43 layers, Low VRAM ON, batch size 512](https://preview.redd.it/t1atth8jbrpd1.png?width=246&format=png&auto=webp&s=66332336958bea0cec1700b5415a0718965c7956)\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions**\n\nIn a scenario where VRAM is scarce (8gb), priority should be given to fitting as many layers onto GPU as possible first, over increasing batch size. Batch sizes lower than 128 are definitely not worth it, 128 probably not worth it either. 256-512 seems to be the sweet spot.   \n  \nMMQ is better kept ON at least on RTX 4060 TI, improving the processing speed considerably (\\~30%) while costing less than 100mb VRAM.\n\nFlash Attention definitely best kept ON for any model that isn't known to have issues with it, major increase in processing speed and crazy VRAM savings (400\\~500mb)\n\nKV cache quantization: 8bit gave substantial VRAM savings (\\~500mb), 4bit provided \\~150mb further savings. However, people claim that this negatively impacts the output of small models like Llama 8b and Mistral 12b (severely in some cases), so probably avoid this setting unless absolutely certain.\n\nLow VRAM: After messing with this option A LOT, i came to the conclusion that it SUCKS and should be avoided. Only one very specific situation managed to squeeze an actual tiny performance boost out of it, but in all other cases where at least around 1/3 of the model fits on GPU already, the performance was considerably better without it. Perhaps it's a different story when even less than 1/3 of the model fits on the gpu, but i didn't test that far.\n\n\n\n**Derived guideline**  \nGeneral steps to find optimal settings for best performance are:   \n1. Turn on MMQ\n\n2. Turn on Flash Attention if the model isn't known to have issues with it\n\n3. If you're on Windows and have an Nvidia GPU - in control panel, make sure that CUDA fallback policy is set to Prefer No System Fallback (this will cause the model to crash instead of dipping into pagefile, this makes it easier to benchmark)\n\n4. Set batch size to 256 and find the maximum number of layers you fit on gpu at your chosen context length without the benchmark crashing\n\n5. At the exact number of layers you ended up with, test if you can increase batch size to 512\n\n6. In case you need more speed, stick with 256 batch size and lower context length, use the freed-up VRAM to cram more layers in, even a couple layers can make a noticeable difference.  \n6.1 In case you need more context, reduce amount of GPU layers and accept the speed penalty.\n\n7. Quantizing KV Cache can provide a significant VRAM reduction, but this option is known to be highly unstable, especially on smaller models, so probably don't use this unless you know what you're doing or you're reading this in 2027 and \"they\" have already optimized their models to work well with 8bit cache.\n\n8. Don't even think about turning Low VRAM ON!!! You have been warned about how useless or outright nasty it is!!!",

It ensures that the context isn't running on the GPU. This helps with extreme context cases but is generally a much slower option. It mimics the behavior that used to be the case when you didn't offload every layer on old versions of KoboldCpp.\n\n\nMMQ we indeed recommend to keep on which is why it does this automatically in the UI.\n\n\nFlashAttention has been hit and miss in the community which is why we don't default to it. Especially for Nvidia cards with full offloads its been great and a must have but from AMD users last time I checked with them it causes a lot of slowdowns. This is also an avoid if you use Vulkan for example although I don't know if Vulkan supports it. There are some edge cases but with models like Gemma 2 that are known not to support it its still fine if you enable FlashAttention and i'd even go as far as recommending it. Yes, the model didn't support it but it will just warn you of this and turn it back off. This way when FlashAttention for a model is added you will begin to use it.",

I'm not doubting that it was a flat 1GB in your case, just saying I don't think it's the case in general.\n\nI think if you were to test with more VRAM or a smaller model (very low parameters or low quantization) you would find that different context sizes occupy different amounts of VRAM, and the \"lowvram\" option frees up whatever that amount is, by putting it in RAM instead of VRAM.\n\nPersonally I find the lowvram option useful, because with it my VRAM fits a Nemo 12B model at Q4\\_K\\_S, whereas without it I can only fit IQ3\\_\\_M.  It's a little bit slower, but the difference in smarts seems well worth it.",

                    "body": "Generally, LLM models output a ranked list of the most likely tokens, called logits.\n\nSamplers take this list of logits and whittle them down to a smaller and smaller list depending on how they work individually, and then often either randomly select one from the final short-list (or sometimes choose one based on their final weighted ranks, so more like ‘semi-random’).\n\nTemperature isn’t a ‘sampler’ but it’s important to understand that it basically adjusts the ‘randomness’ of the output logits, effectively reducing the highest rank and increasing the lowest ranks so that the range of chosen logit rankings are closer together, and thus more of the lower ranked logits end up likely to be chosen.\n\nTop P, for example, lets you set a ‘goal’ rank (let’s say 0.8) and then it will add up the most likely tokens until their weights equal to your goal. So A might be 0.4, be B might be 0.2, C might be 0.2, and D might be .15. If your Top P is set to 0.8, then it will choose from A, B, and C because they add up to exactly 0.8, but then will ignore D and everything below that.\n\nTop K, lets you set a number, let’s say 40, which will take the highest ranked 40 logits.\n\nFor the remaining samplers, if you use a frontend like SillyTavern to chat with koboldcpp’s API, it’s sampler settings menu lets you hover over a little question mark icon next to each sampler, and it gives a little summary of the math of how that sampler works.\n\nYou can also google the name of the more complicated samplers (or even basic ones like typical P, Min P, Top A, etc.) like Mirostat, Smooth Sampling (aka quadratic smoothing) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) sampling, etc. and read through their whitepapers to see explanations with the math and little charts/examples of how they select logits.\n\nYou can generally assume that the more samplers you start using, the smaller the final list of logits being chosen from is, which naturally starts making them repeat and/or produce similar responses. If you were trying to write a sentence and could choose between 3 words, or choose between 20 words, you’d start repeating yourself much faster if you only had 3 words to pick from than if you had 20. Same thing with the model and sampling logits.",

From what I've read the newer versions of Kobold have gotten better at supporting multiple GPUs.  Since I have two PCI 5.0 x16 slots, I was thinking of adding a 12gb 3060 just for the extra vram.  I'm fully aware that the memory bandwidth on a 3060 is about 40% that of a 3090, but I was under the impression that even with the lower bandwidth, the additional vram would still give a noticeable advantage in loading models for inference vs a single 3090 with the rest off loaded to the CPU.

It isn't something you load into kobold as part of loading the model.\n\nOr are you asking about Kobold's 'Kobold Lite' interface? You can adjust this in the settings menu under the format tab. You can either select the instruct tag preset that matches the one suggested in the model card (Alpacca, Chat ML, Llama 3 Chat, etc.), or you can manually edit the system, user, prompt, etc. in the fields below the preset dropdown menu if the model suggests a unique format.\n\nKeep in mind that you do need to make sure you picked instruct mode when you load your character card, though. Just be aware that you won't be prompted to confirm this if you don't have the 'Card Import Prompt' box checked under the settings > advanced tab, so make sure it is, otherwise it will just default to chat mode rather than instruct.\n\nEDIT: I just reread your post and realized you're talking specifically about the context template (ie the order each segment of the system prompt and character data is included in the prompt) not the instruct preset, so just ignore everything I said. I don't think RP models are being trained with data formatted entirely with a specific context template, because it's unreasonable to expect a user to format their prompts that specifically. Which model did you notice this on? I'd like to check into it's datasets if they're public to actually see if it's formatted this way, or if it's just a suggestion in the way that samplers kindof are.\n\nIt's become pretty common for ST users to just share their samplers, context, and instruct .jsons because those three sets of settings basically make the model work the same for each user, so loading all 3 puts ST into a \"known working state.\" It's probably just the model maker's way of saying, \"I know that this works well, so please start with these so I don't have to troubleshoot an incorrectly set up instance of SillyTavern.",

So instead of having a template you have the memory field in the context menu and everything is raw text to format as you see fit. That way your not limited to character cards but can make that anything you like, and prompting styles like I personally use would not work without it. It also means you can use it for purposes other than chat characters.",

Plenty will say it doesn't really matter- that there's probably not a huge difference between having the character description right before the scenario instead of right after, and plenty will likely say they notice big differences by reordering the prompt.\n\nThere's not going to be a definitive answer. Those context templates aren't trained into the model in any way, so they aren't \"required\" in the literal sense. Mistral didn't originally train the model with a given template in mind.\n\nThe templates linked seem to include the system prompt right in the context template as opposed to in its own segment as is usually done in SillyTavern (generally the template is just that- a template to be filled by the listed segments of a card), so you'd probably want to be careful not to then add a conflicting system prompt in the instruct template. This dev does seem to be putting a lot of work into reworking their context templates though (Custom, Custom 2 Custom 2 Electric Boogaloo lol), so it's probably worth exploring, but there's also going to be a group of people suggesting that a model should be good without all that hyperspecific prompting, etc.\n\nMaybe it makes sense for Kobold to stay a simple open ended frontend, and for ST to be much more complex and oriented towards chats, that way there's a solution for everybody.",

It's spawned writing, maps, drawings, Lego MOCs and many random discussions.\n\nI want to continue developing the world in a coherent way. So we've got lore we can build on and any stories, additions etc. we make fit in with the world we've built.\n\nLast night I downloaded KoboldCPP and trialled it with the mistral-6b-openorca.Q4\\_K\\_M model. It could make simple stories, but I realised I need a plan and some advice on how we should proceed.\n\nI was thinking of this approach:\n\n1. Source a comprehensive base language model that's fit for purpose.\n\n2. Load our current content into Kobold (currently around 9,000 words of lore and background).\n\n3. Use Kobold to create short stories about our world.\n\n4. Once we're happy with a story add it to the lore in Kobold.\n\n\n\nWhich leads to a bunch of questions:\n\n1. What language model/s should we use? \n\n2. Kobold has slots for \"Model\", \"Lora\", \"Lora Base\", \"\"LLaVA mmproj\", \"Preloaded Story\" and \"ChatCompletions Adapter\" - which should we be using?\n\n3. Should our lore be a single text file,a JSON file, or do we need to convert it to a GUFF? \n\n4. Does the lore go in the \"Preloaded Story\" slot? How do we combine our lore with the base model?\n\n5. Is it possible to write short stories that are 5,000-10,000 words long while the model still retains and references/ considers 10,000+ words of lore and previous stories?\n\n\n\nMy laptop is a Lenovo Legion 5 running Ubuntu 24.04 with 32GB RAM + Ryzen 7 + RTX4070 (8GB VRAM). Generation doesn't need to be fast - the aim is quality.\n\nI know that any GPT can easily spit out a bland \"story\" a few hundred words long. But my aim is for us to create structured short stories that hold up to the standards of a 13yo and their mates who read a lot of YA fiction. Starting with 1,000-2,000 words would be fine, but the goal is 5,000-10,000 word stories that gradually build up the world.\n\n\n\nBonus question:\n\nHow do we setup the image generation in Kobold so it can generate scenes from the stories that have a cohesive art style and characters between images and stories? Is that even possible in Kobold?\n\n\n\nThank you for your time.",

                    "body": "I'm setting up to do something similar (there's an upcoming tabletop roleplaying game I'm planning to do comprehensive automated note-taking on) but I've only done a little experimenting so far. So this comment is partly advice, and also partly in the vein of \"the fastest way to get a correct answer on the Internet is to give an incorrect answer\" :)\n\nThe question of what language model to use is a doozy. Different models have different hardware requirements and different capabilities, and it's all a bit of black magic trying to benchmark them. One of the important capabilities you're going to need is a model with a large context length. The context length determines how much stuff the model can hold in its \"active memory\", which is where you're going to be putting the notes you've made as well as the ongoing discussion you're having with the AI.\n\nI am fortunate to have bought myself a fairly substantial graphics card so I went for a pretty big model, based on my initial investigation I was led to believe that [Command-R](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/c4ai-command-r-08-2024-GGUF) is specifically intended for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation). But I think with 8GB of VRAM that might be too big for your system to work nicely. Even though speed isn't important I think you'll agree that having the AI grind out one word every ten seconds would be infuriating, especially when after a couple of minutes it becomes clear that the sentence it's trying to create is \"I didn't quite understand what you just asked me, could you clarify blah blah blah etc.\" :)\n\nSince I don't have a broad range of experience with other models I won't give a specific recommendation here. Hopefully someone else will chime in with a good one that handles a lengthy context.\n\n> Kobold has slots for \"Model\", \"Lora\", \"Lora Base\", \"\"LLaVA mmproj\", \"Preloaded Story\" and \"ChatCompletions Adapter\" - which should we be using?\n\nThe model is the only vital part here. That's the main \"brains\" of your AI. Loras are a sort of \"modifier\" that can be loaded overtop of the model to make it behave differently, it's an advanced feature that's probably not going to be relevant.\n\n\"Preloaded story\" might be of some use to you, once you've set up your AI with the information it needs in its context you could save that session and then set it here so that whenever you start this particular AI it'll have that already in its context.\n\nChatCompletions Adapter might be useful to set, they contain hints on the particular \"dialect\" the model uses when it's talking. You're using a Mistral model right now so the Mistral adapter might help KoboldCPP work more smoothly. I actually didn't set that for a long time when I first started messing with KoboldCPP so I'm not sure how vital it is.\n\n> Should our lore be a single text file,a JSON file, or do we need to convert it to a GUFF? \n\nThere's a couple of ways you can get your lore into the chat's context that I know of.\n\nThe simplest would be to start the conversation with \"Hey, KoboldGPT, I've created an imaginary world over the past couple of years. I want to continue developing the world in a coherent way. So we've got lore we can build on and any stories, additions etc. we make fit in with the world we've built. Here it is...\" And then paste the giant text dump in. The big downside of this approach is that as you continue talking with the AI the context will continue to get longer and longer, and eventually the oldest stuff might start getting dropped to make room for newer stuff.\n\nA better approach would be to edit the context of the session directly. Click the gear icon in the lower right of KoboldCPP's interface, then the \"Context\" button. This gives you access to some special fields where you can put information that *won't* end up being removed from the context over time.\n\nThe \"Memory\" field is a block of text that's always present at the top of the context. Put all the most important stuff in here that the AI should always know about the setting. This is always at the top of your context.\n\nThe \"Author's Note\" is for stuff you'd like the AI to keep in mind *right now*, but maybe isn't always important. If you're writing a story, for example, this would be a good place to put a note like \"the heroes are currently in the lost caverns of Tscarnoth, trying to find their way out.\" That way the AI won't lose track of what's going on right now, but later on it's easy to update with new information once circumstances change.\n\nThe \"World Info\" tab is where things start getting fancy. This allows you to put a bunch of short \"facts\" into memory with keywords associated with them, so that they only get inserted into the context when they are actually mentioned. For example you could have an entry describing what the Lost Caverns of Tscarnoth are like under the keywords \"caverns, tscarnoth\" and then whenever a character mentions one of those words that information will be inserted into the context so the AI will know about it.\n\nSince you already have a bunch of text pre-written, what you might find easiest is to save a session as a .json file with a few bits of example information in them and then open the .json file in a text editor to bulk-add more stuff. I find this easier than working with KoboldCPP's web interface much of the time. Then you can load that session back in and it'll all be there.\n\nYou don't have to preload the story, you can manually do that after starting KoboldCPP up.\n\n> I know that any GPT can easily spit out a bland \"story\" a few hundred words long. But my aim is for us to create structured short stories that hold up to the standards of a 13yo and their mates who read a lot of YA fiction. Starting with 1,000-2,000 words would be fine, but the goal is 5,000-10,000 word stories that gradually build up the world.\n\nI've done a small amount of tinkering with this and I don't know of a good way to do this *automatically*, but a little work \"by hand\" can accomplish a lot. First generate the overall outline of the story, and then fill in the outline a few pages at a time. I've found that a lot of AIs really love to jump to the end of the story if you're not constantly reigning it in with \"we're starting here and writing up to here, no further.\"",

I use [Claude Projects](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9517075-what-are-projects) - which might work well for this use case.

                    "body": "> For using \"Command-R\" as my model I went to the \"Files and versions\" tab in Huggingface - https://huggingface.co/bartowski/c4ai-command-r-08-2024-GGUF/tree/main - and got 25 different options. Do you have any suggestions on which I should try out first with my 8GB of VRAM?\n\nHonestly, \"something other than Command-R\" would be my suggestion. :) I've got 24GB of VRAM and Command-R chugs pretty hard when I run it. If you go to the [main page for that model](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/c4ai-command-r-08-2024-GGUF) you'll see a list of recommendations for which of the various different files might be suitable. You'll see this on a lot of GGUF models at Huggingface. Basically, GGUF is a method of \"compressing\" AI models so that they don't take up as much space or memory. But as with most methods of compression, the more you compress the data the less \"good\" the result is. Highly compressed models tend to get dumber. So you need to strike a balance between the general qualities of \"big model, therefore smart\" and \"highly compressed, therefore actually usable\".\n\nThe version I'm using right now is Q4_K_M, but I'm not sure that'd be runable on your system. If you don't mind trying a 19 GB download that may not work, though, might as well give it a shot.\n\nAs I said in my giant wall of text, I'm unfortunately not widely versed in a lot of different models so I don't have much advice to give for what alternatives are good. There are a lot of models out there that are based on the Llama-3.1-8B model, it's a lot slimmer. I've used the [Celeste 8B model](https://huggingface.co/nothingiisreal/L3.1-8B-Celeste-V1.5?not-for-all-audiences=true) before, it's good at storytelling kinds of things. [GGUF versions of it are here](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/L3.1-8B-Celeste-V1.5-GGUF?not-for-all-audiences=true). If you want to try something a little fancier to see if your computer can handle it there's also [12B Celeste models](https://huggingface.co/nothingiisreal/Celeste-12B-V1.6), I haven't tried these but there's a link to some GGUF versions of them on its model page.\n\n> Are the limitations of \"World Info\" based on the model?\n\nYeah. Different models have different limits on how big their context can be. If the model doesn't tell you explicitly then look at the spew of output that Koboldcpp puts into the terminal window when you launch a model with it, the parameter you're looking for is \"n_ctx_train\". That tells you how many tokens of context (ctx) the model was trained to understand. You'll need to tell Kobold to actually *use* that many tokens when you launch it, too.\n\nEdit: Sorry, I got a little confused and missed the switch from \"context\" to \"World Info\". As mentioned elsewhere, the entire World Info isn't put into context at once, so you don't have to worry quite so much about context size when you're using world info.\n\n\"Token count\" and \"word count\" are not identical, but they're a reasonably comparable ballpark figure. If you want to get a feel for what tokens are like you might want to play around with [OpenAI's tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer). Different models use different tokenizers so again it's not a 1:1 comparison, but it might be illuminating to see how these LLMs actually perceive the input they're getting. The reason ChatGPT has so much trouble counting the \"r\"s in \"Strawberry\" is more understandable when you know that ChatGPT sees the word \"Strawberry\" as \"[3504, 1134, 19772]\" :)\n\n> Projects have knowledge bases where you can upload files for context. \n\nI haven't used Claude Projects myself, but what I'm guessing is happening here is that it's doing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with those files. So they're not being placed directly into the context in their entirety, but rather bits of them get placed in there based on a built-in search engine trying to figure out what's most relevant to the current subject at hand.\n\nIt's similar to the World Info tab. Not all of the contents of the World Info will be placed in the context at once, it'll be inserted based on whether the tags associated with them have come up.\n\nHeh. There I go spewing walls of text again. :)\n\nI hope this works out well for you. This tech is all still very new, so tools like Koboldcpp are still rather \"raw\" an not very user-friendly in a lot of ways. Eventually the tech will settle down a bit and the tools will catch up, but for now I'm not going to complain about how every month brings a new revolution in capacity.",

Set up World-Info (in wich World are U living, Planet, Galaxy...)  \n2. Create your own character (who U are)  \n3. Create Narrator (if wanted, telling things what is going on)  \n4. Create other characters (your buddys!)  \n5.
