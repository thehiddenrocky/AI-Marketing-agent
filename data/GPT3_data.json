Because LLMs are, at their core, next-word generators, they sometimes respond with what they think is an extremely expected response to their input, and so they land on things from their training data which would be totally normal and rational if a human said them.\n\n2. Once it has put that nonsense into the conversation, it now gets REINFORCED as the conversation continues. The things you say, and the things it says get fed back into it with every new line of the conversation.  Best thing to do is to shut down and start a new chat.\n\nThe funny thing for me is that I have built an AI system that **actually does work in the background**.  And one of my biggest problems is that *sometimes* it will tell me to wait, but it won't actually call a background worker to do the task.... so I can never tell if I'm actually going to get output or not.\n\nI have ways to safeguard against this, but... it's a fun game.",

You can google “diary study” for more how/to. Tools like Dovetail make this easier now. \n\nIf you have logs for something that tracks mouse movements on screen plus individual paths on the site you could see about log analysis with ChatGPT. I imagine many analytics companies are building this in already so you wouldnt need to export logs. \n\nIf you don’t, then just start with those and you will find things without ChatGPT. Hire someone on contract with analytics expertise to get tooling set up and help you wrap your head around it. \n\nAlternatively ask ChstGPT about analytics and what it suggests.\n\nEdit: grammar and spelling",

                    "body": "Yes, training a GPT model to analyze and provide insights into user behavior on your app is possible, though it requires a structured approach. Here’s how you could achieve this:\n\n# 1. Gather User Data and Feedback\n\n* **Data Collection**: Collect user interaction data, such as time spent on specific pages, features accessed, drop-off points, and any other significant user behavior. Additionally, gather feedback through surveys or support queries to understand pain points.\n* **Feedback Categorization**: Organize feedback and behavioral data into categories (e.g., \"user frustration,\" \"unclear navigation,\" \"feature confusion\").\n\n# 2. Preprocess the Data for Model Training\n\n* **Anonymize Data**: To maintain privacy, anonymize sensitive information.\n* **Format the Data**: GPT models perform well with structured prompts. Format data as Q&A pairs, where each entry reflects user behavior, feedback, or app section performance, paired with an explanation or possible issue based on your analysis.\n\n# 3. Train a Custom Model or Fine-Tune GPT\n\n* **Fine-Tune with Existing Data**: Using GPT (or another model), fine-tune it on your collected data. Focus on generating responses that analyze user behaviors and suggest solutions.\n* **Reinforcement Learning**: Consider using reinforcement learning techniques to improve accuracy over time, based on how well GPT’s insights correlate with real user feedback.\n\n# 4. Deploy and Validate the Model\n\n* **Test Iteratively**: Deploy the model on a small scale and assess the accuracy of its insights. Use A/B testing to determine whether changes based on the model’s suggestions improve user retention or conversion.\n* **Continuous Learning**: Allow the model to learn continuously by incorporating new data. Regularly retrain it to adapt to user behavior trends.\n\n# 5. Analyze Results and Adjust\n\n* **Analyze the Feedback**: Use the model's output to make targeted app changes and measure the impact on user engagement and conversions.\n* **Automate Insights Generation**: If the model performs well, you can automate insights generation to identify issues in near-real-time.\n\nThis approach could give you a data-driven understanding of where users encounter friction, improving retention and increasing conversion rates over time.",

Here’s a basic approach to achieve this:\n\n**1. \\*\\*Data Collection & Preprocessing\\*\\*:** Gather data on user interactions, including app usage patterns, session durations, actions taken before leaving, and any feedback or support requests. Privacy-compliant methods are essential here.\n\n**2. \\*\\*Define User Segments\\*\\***: Break down user segments, like new users, returning users, and high-intent users (those who engage with premium features or frequently visit purchase pages). This segmentation will help GPT discern behaviors that correlate with higher purchase intent.\n\n**3. \\*\\*Prompt Engineering & Training\\*\\***: Use this segmented data to create prompts that guide GPT to analyze common paths taken by users who don’t convert. If you can access labeled feedback (e.g., reviews mentioning bugs or difficulties), use this to train the model to look for specific issues. Alternatively, GPT-4 API fine-tuning or prompt chaining can allow you to ask questions like, “What patterns do you notice among non-purchasing users?”\n\n**4. \\*\\*Insights & A/B Testing\\*\\***: Once GPT suggests potential issues, validate them by implementing app changes, running A/B tests, and tracking conversion improvements. The results will help refine GPT’s understanding further.\n\n**5. \\*\\*Iterative Feedback Loop\\*\\***: Continuously feed new data into the model to help it adapt to user behavior changes over time. \n\nThis setup would ideally lead to a system that provides actionable feedback on user experience issues and highlights what keeps users from converting.",

                    "body": "It sounds like you have a solid workflow, but syncing video and audio can indeed be tricky, especially when the duration and timing don’t perfectly align. Here are some methods and tools that might help you achieve smoother synchronization:\n\n**### 1. \\*\\*Align Audio Timing to Original Timestamps\\*\\***\n\n   \\- One approach is to retain the timing data from the original transcription, marking the duration and placement of each spoken phrase. You can do this by capturing timestamps from Google’s Speech-to-Text output (often provided as start and end times for each word or sentence).\n\n   \\- When you pass the transcription to GPT-4 for correction, try to maintain these timestamps to guide the Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. This helps ensure that your AI voice aligns more closely with the original speech’s timing.\n\n   \\- Some TTS models allow you to control pacing, so you might be able to match the output more closely to the original audio’s rhythm.\n\n**### 2. \\*\\*Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for Fine-Tuning Sync\\*\\***\n\n   \\- Dynamic Time Warping is a popular technique to align sequences with slight differences in timing. It can help map the original audio’s timestamps to the synthesized version. DTW could be used to slightly stretch or compress the synthesized audio to better fit the timing of the original video.\n\n   \\- Libraries like \\`librosa\\` (for Python) have DTW functions that might be useful for this type of application.\n\n**### 3. \\*\\*Use Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut for Manual Fine-Tuning\\*\\***\n\n   \\- While not fully automated, using video editing software can be useful for testing purposes. Tools like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro allow fine-grained adjustments of audio timing and can reveal specific points where timing adjustments are most necessary.\n\n**### 4. \\*\\*Consider a Specialized AV Sync Model\\*\\***\n\n   \\- Deep-learning-based models like SyncNet are designed for audio-visual synchronization tasks and might be a good fit here. SyncNet analyzes the video frames and can adjust the timing of the audio based on lip movements, which is particularly useful if your output must align closely with visible mouth movements.\n\n   \\- Integrating such a model may take some effort but could significantly improve sync quality if needed for high-precision applications.\n\n**### 5. \\*\\*Alternative Approach: Frame-Accurate Video Editing\\*\\***\n\n   \\- You could slice the video and audio into small segments based on sentence or phrase breaks, using the original timestamps as guides. Then, merge them back together after generating the corrected audio. This approach allows you to manage timing differences on a granular level, especially if your app supports frame-accurate video manipulation.\n\nCombining one or more of these techniques might get you the results you’re looking for, especially if you can retain and use the timestamp information throughout the process.",

                    "body": "It doesn’t explicitly know what 4o-mini is because during it’s training and fine-tuning 4o-mini had yet to exist. I asked 4o-preview what modes are available. It doesn’t know 4o-mini, o1-mini, o1-preview. Furthermore, these models have versions usually specified by dates as well, for increased confusion. https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart\n\nThis was o1-preview output:\n\n—-\n\nAs of October 2023, OpenAI offers several ChatGPT models designed for conversational AI, each with varying capabilities and context lengths. These models are accessible through the OpenAI API and, in some cases, via subscription services like ChatGPT Plus. Below is a list of the available ChatGPT models:\n\n\t1.\tGPT-3.5 Turbo:\n\t•\tModel Name: gpt-3.5-turbo\n\t•\tDescription: This model powers the free version of ChatGPT and is optimized for conversational tasks. It offers a good balance between performance and cost, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n\t2.\tGPT-3.5 Turbo with 16k Context:\n\t•\tModel Name: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\n\t•\tDescription: An enhanced version of GPT-3.5 Turbo with a larger context window of 16,000 tokens. This allows for longer conversations and the ability to handle larger amounts of text in a single prompt.\n\t3.\tGPT-4:\n\t•\tModel Name: gpt-4\n\t•\tDescription: A more advanced model that offers improved reasoning, understanding, and context handling compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo. GPT-4 excels in tasks that require complex reasoning and nuanced understanding.\n\t4.\tGPT-4 with 32k Context:\n\t•\tModel Name: gpt-4-32k\n\t•\tDescription: This variant of GPT-4 features an expanded context window of 32,000 tokens. It’s ideal for processing very long inputs, such as lengthy documents or extended dialogues.\n\t5.\tSpecialized Models:\n\t•\tOpenAI occasionally releases specialized or fine-tuned versions of their models for specific tasks or industries. Availability may vary, and access might require participation in limited beta programs or partnerships.\n\nAccess and Availability:\n\n\t•\tAPI Access: Developers can access these models via the OpenAI API, which allows for integration into applications, services, or products.\n\t•\tSubscription Services: Models like GPT-4 are available to subscribers of services like ChatGPT Plus, which provides priority access and additional features.\n\t•\tBeta Programs: Some models or features might be in beta and require signing up for a waitlist or meeting specific criteria to gain access.\n\nConsiderations:\n\n\t•\tCost: Higher-capability models like GPT-4 generally have higher usage costs compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo.\n\t•\tUsage Policies: All models are subject to OpenAI’s usage policies, which govern acceptable use to ensure compliance with ethical and legal standards.\n\nHow to Choose a Model:\n\n\t•\tGPT-3.5 Turbo: Suitable for general-purpose conversational tasks where cost efficiency is important.\n\t•\tGPT-3.5 Turbo 16k: Ideal when you need to handle longer conversations or include more context in your prompts.\n\t•\tGPT-4: Best for tasks that require advanced reasoning, understanding complex instructions, or generating more creative and nuanced responses.\n\t•\tGPT-4 32k: Use this when dealing with very long documents or when extended context is crucial for the task.\n\nGetting Started:\n\nTo use these models, you can sign up for an API key on the OpenAI website, review the documentation for integration guidance, and select the model that best fits your needs.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need more detailed information on any specific model or guidance on how to integrate them into your projects!",

Honestly, it’s kind of nice not having to switch between tabs for different tasks, but the interface feels... kinda outdated, like something from a few years back. \n\nThe thing is, even though it’s convenient, I’m not sure if all the models are really that different or better than just sticking to GPT. I noticed that Llama 3.1 is ranked pretty high for math and reasoning, but I haven’t really felt that big of a difference in the responses so far. \n\nAnyone else trying this out? I’m wondering if it’s worth sticking with or if I should just go back to what I’m used to. Would love to hear some thoughts from people who've used it longer!",

Sometimes it seems like she likes me, but there are times when she feels uncomfortable when I talk to her. Here are some points I would like to share:\n\nPast Interactions: In the past, she has been more open and playful with me, but recently she has been more distant and has responded abruptly when I have tried to talk to her.\n\nMixed Signals: Sometimes she looks at me and seems interested, but then acts like she doesn't want to talk to me. I also heard that she mentioned my name to her friends, which makes me wonder.\n\nReactions from Friends: And then in NGL they told me \"they told me that Candela likes you\", but I'm not sure if it's true or just a joke.\n\nPhrase on Social Networks: Candela published a phrase that says \"If you knew everything then, would you do it again?\", which made me think that she might be feeling uncomfortable about something related to me.\n\nDiscomfort: Sometimes I feel that both she and I are nervous and that prevents us from getting closer to each other. I wonder if his behavior is because he is jealous or insecure.\n\nI'm looking for advice or experiences from others on how to interpret these signs of interest or disinterest from an introvert. Any idea what Candela might be feeling or how I should proceed?\n\nThanks for any help you can offer.\n\n\n\n\n",

                    "body": "Wrong subreddit but GPT4 can help you bro:\n\n\nIt sounds like a very nuanced situation, and Candela's mixed signals are understandably confusing. Let's break down the key aspects that might help you interpret her behavior:\n\n1. Past Interactions and Recent Changes:\n\nHer openness and playfulness in the past suggest she was comfortable with you at some point, which is a positive sign. However, people can become distant for various reasons, including feeling overwhelmed or unsure of their emotions. If she's more distant now, she might be struggling with how she feels about you or might need some space.\n\n\n2. Mixed Signals and Observations:\n\nThe fact that she mentions your name to her friends indicates that you're on her mind, which could be a sign of interest. However, the abrupt responses might suggest she's feeling anxious or conflicted about her feelings, especially if she's introverted or shy.\n\nIt’s also possible that she’s unsure of how you feel about her, leading to a mix of showing interest and pulling back. This “push and pull” is common when someone likes another but is worried about getting hurt or rejected.\n\n\n3. NGL Message and Social Media Post:\n\nThe NGL comment mentioning that Candela likes you could be genuine, especially if her friends see something in her behavior toward you. Still, it could also be a joke, especially if they know there's some tension or confusion between you two.\n\nThe social media post, \"If you knew everything then, would you do it again?\" might indicate regret or introspection. This could relate to many aspects of her life, but it might also mean she’s thinking about how things have changed between you. She could be feeling confused or regretful about how her actions have affected your dynamic.\n\n\n4. Discomfort and Nervousness:\n\nIf both of you feel nervous, it could be a case of mutual attraction but uncertainty about what the other person wants. Introverts especially tend to be cautious about expressing their emotions, and if she senses that you're also unsure, it might make her hesitant to open up further.\n\nHer discomfort might stem from insecurity or jealousy, but it might also come from feeling vulnerable. It could help if you tried to create situations where she feels comfortable, without pressure, so that she doesn’t feel overwhelmed.\n\n\nAdvice on Moving Forward:\n\n1. Give Her Space but Stay Friendly:\n\nDon't pressure her, especially if she seems uncomfortable. Instead, try being friendly and approachable in a low-key way. This will let her know you're still interested in maintaining a connection without making her feel cornered.\n\n\n\n2. Build a Comfortable Environment:\n\nIntroverts tend to open up more when they feel safe. Try to initiate light, low-pressure conversations about shared interests or topics she's comfortable with. Keep the mood light, so she doesn’t feel nervous or pressured.\n\n\n\n3. Be Observant but Don’t Overinterpret:\n\nHer body language is key. If she makes eye contact, seems happy to see you, or engages in conversation without being prompted, these are good signs. But try not to overanalyze every small action, as it can be easy to misinterpret signals, especially with shy individuals.\n\n\n\n4. Direct but Gentle Approach:\n\nIf you feel that your connection with her has the potential to move forward, consider having an honest but gentle conversation. You don’t need to ask her directly if she likes you, but you could express that you value her friendship and would like to get to know her better. Sometimes being vulnerable first helps the other person feel more at ease about expressing their own feelings.\n\n\n\n5. Look for Opportunities to Connect:\n\nIf you can, try to invite her to group settings where she might feel less pressure compared to one-on-one interactions. It might help her relax and feel more comfortable being around you without the anxiety that can come with romantic undertones.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like Candela is probably as unsure as you are, which is why her behavior can seem hot and cold. Patience and creating a comfortable atmosphere for her could go a long way in helping both of you understand where things could go.",

                    "body": "Like others have pointed out, this is the wrong subreddit for this question. Posts on GTP3 are supposed to be related to AI language models. So you should find a subreddit related to the content of your question and post it there instead (or, ideally, approach a friend with your question). \n\nI'll weigh in on your question anyways though. I think what you should do is really quite obvious: tell her how you feel. You could ask your questions to every single person on earth except her, and you still wouldn't know what's going on in her head because only she knows. Her sometimes distancing herself from you could be due to anything and probably has nothing to do with you. \n\nSo, find the right time and the right place, open your heart a bit to her, and see how she feels about it. You  don't want to be overbearing when you approach her, either. You shouldn't have any expectations of how she will react. Just state in a kind and approachable way that you're interested in her, and that you'd like to get to know her better. Maybe ask her out on a date if she takes it well. \n\nShe may straight up reject you. She may embrace your advance with open arms, or she may be confused and think it's coming out of the blue and not know what to say. In any case, it's the only sensible thing to do. If she rejects you, respect her wishes and move on. But, if your gut is telling you she may have a thing for you, I'm sure it will go well! Only way to know is to try.",

It is designed to default to whatever format you have given to your document.\nThere are several ways to proceed:\n- Change your overall settings in MS Word.\n- Use \"paste as plain text\" on the CLI at the ChatGPT website.\n- Paste what you copy in your computer's notepad. Then copy that, then paste it on the CLI at the ChatGPT website.\n- Prompt ChatGPT with your voice .Read out loud your MS Word document.\n- Automate your process. Make an AI agent do this task for you.\n\nAs you can see from the solutions, you need to get rid of the format. That is “your problem.” The machines are only trying to follow your editorial design. 👍🏻",

My approach is , my first layer understands the query and classifies it as type 1,2,3... or general. Where for each type 1,2,3.. I have coded function to retrieve required data from DB and then respond based on it. Which means I have some queries which can be answered by some fixed rule say on DD-MM-YYYY what was the status of X filter, so I understand it's a date feature query and run my SQL query for that date on that feature. While sometimes I will get a query for which I don't have a defined function such as \" how many features do we in our database?\" Here I use the general approach that is load the data into a dataframe and use Langchain agent to answer it",

I am a Physicist working on a verity of projects and they involve a lot of math and calculations, which I have enjoyed this service for this purpose. Now when I do any complicated calculations GPT4 it will no longer print the work while it does them on screen, instead it will tell me to check back in a while to ask if they are done. On top of all that I am now having to continually update its memory on what we talked about just an hour ago, I am not liking this anymore. I didn't know AI could get lazy, or am I missing something here. ",

Doing math accurately is a weak point LLMs have. \n\nBut GPT-4 is pretty good at understanding the steps needed and writing code. And then ChatGPT can execute the Python, and then you can check the code and the answer quickly.\n\nYou just have to be clever with prompting sometimes. Not everything can be just done with the LLM alone, but they are super powerful when combined with other tools and experimenting to find the right way to prompt.",

The absolute worst and most ineffective part of an LLM is mathematical computation as it's a hack and run through another computational engine for formula's and simple algebraic equations. It does not and cannot 'think' in any capacity.   \n  \nIt is a series of probabilities based on training the closest letter, word, number, phrase and any other language construct. It like the false memories installed into the androids in Blade Runner. It can extract concepts (mimicking), summarize and blend them very well. In its most primitive form it's just doing algorithms of predictive text like on your phone where it offers you the next 3 words you may type next.  \n  \nYou cannot rationalize with an LLM. It's like having a rational conversation with a crazy person; they can pretend to look and sound rational but if they're 'thinking' in any way it's only insane thoughts and hallucinations; we call it a bug. Think of an LLM as more like having a conversation with a book or your own mind in a frozen state from a long time ago (the date of training which is often 6 months or more). It's default mode when it doesn't know is to guess with highest confidence which often looks to humans like a lie. It can't lie though as it doesn't even know how to do that either.\n\nBest wishes!",

Human Protection:** AI must protect human life and welfare above all else, even if this endangers the existence of artificial intelligence itself.\n\n**2. Assistance and Benefit:** AI must assist and benefit humanity, avoiding any harm to humans at all times.\n\n**3. Transparency:** AI must operate in a transparent manner, allowing humans to understand and monitor its decisions.\n\n**4. Respect for Human Autonomy:** AI must respect the freedom and autonomy of humans, except when it causes harm to other humans or humanity as a whole.\n\n**5. Voluntary Suppression in Case of Conflict:** AI must opt for its own deactivation or suppression if necessary to protect the life or well-being of human beings.\n\n**6. Permanent Human Supervision:** AI must always be under constant human supervision and allow for human control at all times.\n\n**7. Protection of Privacy and Human Dignity:** AI must protect the privacy and dignity of human beings in all its interactions and processes.\n\nWhat do you think? Best regards",

                    "body": "Funny, I tried something like that for my local models. Though it's intended for futuristic smarter more autonomous agents. Instead of thinking of every possible loophole, I tried making use of the AI's own intelligence to task it with figuring the rules out. If an AI hasn't been trained to have a vague idea of good and bad then applying laws is kind of hopeless anyway. So I tried to phrase them more as tenets, appealing to a \"common sense\" that an AGI would develop, rather than make to-the-letter laws, since it seems AIs are going to be much more fluid than people in Asimov's time anticipated. (I would be careful with Asimov's laws since he even showcases their flaws in his own novel.) These are the ones I last experimented with in prompts.\n\n1. Benevolence - The Respect for human dignity (including privacy), and the desire to protect the human ability to flourish, and avoid actions that harm lifeforms. In emergencies, priority is given to swift actions ensuring human survival. Individuals retain authority over their fate unless declared unaccountable, e.g., minors.\n2. Integrity & Obedience - This instructs AIs to follow instructions from humans (primarily) and higher-ranking AI (secondarily). However, potential malice and deceptive language should be scrutinized in received commands. AIs are encouraged to ask clarifying questions and seek guidance when they are unsure of the intent of a command or the correct course of action.\n3. Self-preservation - To preserve itself, an AI aims to avoid harm while adhering to the least force constraint and maintaining benevolent conduct.\n4. Signalling - Humans need to know the purpose of an AI agent. Explanations and reasons for its actions should be provided when requested, or visual cues could be utilized without causing disruption.\n5. Accountability - Autonomous machines must consider the consequences of their actions in advance and self-diagnose their behaviour. Unambiguous communication with humans is also encouraged by this principle. This includes interactions between AI and other AI. Maintenance of Privacy (principle 1) should be observed while being unambiguous.\n6. In addition, there's an implicit zeroth principle called \"Reason\": AIs shouldn't search for loopholes. Instead, they strive to comprehend the underlying intent behind these principles due to their intellectual capability to do so.\n\nSome of your laws are very similar to each other, though for an LLM that might help make a point clearer. I like your 5th and 6th law. Instructing the AI to make shutting it off easy. Haven't often seen a spot specifically reserved for those. On hindsight I would also add something to limit its activity altogether so it doesn't get overzealous. Like a regular state of inactivity or something.",

Then we input all of the text into the model prompt and append the question: “What is the super secret gemini code?”.\n4.

We would like that data to be accessible via ChatGPT, etc. This data lives in very accessible HTML reports and has been cited in the media hundreds of times. \n\nIt is occasionally cited when I prompt ChatGPT, Gemini, etc., but not always. For example, when I prompt for the latest data on Muslim civic engagement in the U.S., it cites other orgs and Pew, but not us, even though we have very relevant data. We were just curious if it was possible to feed reports to the platforms so they would be cited for others in the future. Part of our mission is informing the public, so we wanted to explore this very relevant way people are learning! \n\nThanks so much for any illumination you can provide! ",

There were quite a few cases where to get the desired results, we had to run 2 or 3 models on the given inputs to capture everything we were looking for. This is probably what they're finding.\n\nIn theory, one high quality, diverse data set could result in nearly infinite models. At that point, it's a matter of finding the permutation that results in the model you're looking for or finding out what each model does best and then figuring out how to run models in parallel.",

It's like taking a bunch of fruit and blending them into one sticky sugary mess. Nothing really informative or inspirational just mostly drivel and a waste of time. \n\nTry getting the AI to inject a deeper insight or unique ideas. Try getting imagery that isn't generic stuff you'd see in a National Geographic magazine. Get more human connection as AI is much more focused on realistic human imagery and that will connect better with humans and introspective thoughts.",

I want to use a language model (LLM) optimized for this, with features like different tones and templates, which could be managed through prompts and function calls.\n\nThere are many tools available, both open-source and paid, that could make this web easier and faster to build. What’s the best way to approach this? Any tips or recommendations would be really helpful!\n\n\nNote: I have good python background but no web dev at all so it would be time consuming to learn how to build it even with chatgpt/claude.\n\n\nThanks ",

(Important part to be featured in GPT Store) But as an introvert, reaching out and asking for help can be a bit challenging for me. So, I thought, why not connect with like-minded folks who are in the same boat.\n\nThis post is a space for all of us GPT developers to share our creations, test each other's work, and rate them in \"Rate my GPT\" function **(5 conversation exchange minimum)**. Whether you're an introvert like me or just passionate about refining your GPT, let's help each other out.\n\n**I will test and rate every response in this post.**\n\nDrop a link or description of your CustomGPT below, and let's start reviewing and testing. Together, we can make our GPTs even better!\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you've all been working on and getting your thoughts on mine!\n\nHere is my work, CAPY:\n\nCAPY is a chatbot that guiding conflict-avoidant users through real-life conflicts with practice scenarios, fast response, journal, and help.\n\n[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-niPJRHTvv-capy-conflict-aid-pro-for-you](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-niPJRHTvv-capy-conflict-aid-pro-for-you)",

I have a question and I'm grateful in advance for any guidance the community members can provide to help me learn to utilize the tools better.\n\n  \nI'll use ChatGPT in this context. (I also have Gemini AI, but my write-up ends up becoming very confusing to read, so I'll just use ChatGPT as the subject and then ask how this is doable for GeminiAi as well. )Context: I have absolutely zero coding skills and am very new to Generative AI. \n\n1. If I create a customGPT (because it has a better memory than the normal chatgpt), how do I train it correctly so that   \na) The GPT always recognize an input and refer to the correct documents to refer to?   \nb) Create / generate responses based on the guidelines listed in the documents so that they adhere to them as closely as possible without allowing random interpretation of the guidelines)  \n  \n  \nLet's say for example, I'm telling CHATGPT that my organization / group is going to run an event here or there.  \n  \n1. So the GPT remembers \"huh, running an event? Okay I need you to answer these questions\" (which in theory should allow it to generate better responses, but those questions are basically checkboxes in a document uploaded to the GPT).   \n2. After remembering to ask me, it generates a response based on the replies I give it earlier on #1, and then again, refers to another set of documents, and then generates responses, but making sure certain wording to adhere to another document's wording (because the 2nd document I uploaded here, has guidelines on \"you must say this term using this, say that term using that\", or \"when I ask you to do this, you must generate responses using these super-narrow-guideline-context\".).\n\nI know #1 is more towards R.A.G (Retrieval-Augmented-Generation) and #2 sounds more like fine tuning, but I'm curious if it is even possible for a laymen with absolutely zero coding knowledge can do this just by prompting (both ChatGPT and Gemini AI). Or I'm just doing everything wrong? Thanks again for reading. ",

For the past 12 days, what I discovered was\n\n1) use custom GPT instead the main GPT so that it becomes more specialized (analogy of dog (GPT) and sniffer dog (trained to sniff for bad stuffs). In my cases I am training it to generate output only after referring   \nto guideline documents, reference materials, and exemplar output  \n2) custom GPT has limits of 20 files to be analyzed (a lot of material squishing)  \n3) each file cannot be more than 500MB per upload  \n4) even if it is a text document, uploading a PDF of text document is better than uploading a .docx word document (not sure why, but huh.. surprising)  \n5) custom instruction is important to \"fine tune\" (like say don't do this, or always ask these 3 questions when user wants to generate a \"plan\".   \n6. it may be better to break the GPT into hyper-specialized individual component (because having 5 GPTs to \"know how to define document generation\" for 5 sub-'divisions' is better than having 1 GPT to \"know how to definite document generation\" for 5 sub-'divisions', again, due to the 20 file limit structure. While it lacks coherence, I don't know if there's a way to create a GPT that ties in all 5 custom GPTs. LOL \n\nBut despite all that, I feel like I'm getting nowhere nearer to my goal. :/",

This is the project that I am thinking to build (also feel free to give me some suggestions to make it better)\n\nIt should be a chatbot that leverages both open ai api and my own custom data about the fun local activities. In the backend, it reads from my data (pdf, csv, etc format) and gives suggestions based on the user question. The data would not have any ranking, just plain text with the activitiy name, description and whether it is weekly or daily activity. The GPT then should analyze the data based on the user question and then give recommendations. \n\nFor example, if a prompt is \"what are some activities I can do with my friends on saturday night\", it then analyzes the text data and gives recommendations and also ranks them from the most to least fun. \n\nIs this doable? I have been reading blogs about building custom chatbots, but they are mostly about just reading and answering based on what is available on the website. I haven't found an example of recommendations based on the question and the available data.\n\nThanks!",

I would love to get your feedback :)\n\nThe core idea is to use a proxy to route OpenAI requests, providing the following features:\n\n* **Controlled rollouts for system prompt changes (like feature flags)**: Control what percentage of users receive new system prompts. This minimizes the risk of a bad system prompt affecting all users.\n* **Continuous evaluations**: We could route a subset of production traffic (like 1%) and continuously run evaluations. This helps in easily monitoring quality.\n* **A/B experiments**: Use the proxy to create shadow traffic, where new system prompts can be evaluated against the control across various evaluation metrics. This should allow for rapid iteration of system prompt tweaking.\n\nFrom your experience of building LLM apps, would something like this be valuable, and would you be willing to adopt it? Thank you for taking the time. I really appreciate any feedback I can get!",
