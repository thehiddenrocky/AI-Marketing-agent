She does give me some of her. Zillow leads or allows me to take interact with some of them which will lead to a 10% to 12% commission and after a year in being in this agency, I’m kind of thinking about possibly switching brokerages. since I haven’t really learned too much with her other. Since I am focusing on being a seller agent I do have a couple leads in the pipeline at the moment, but I’m wondering if I move brokerages well these other brokerages help me out with getting familiar with contracts.

You can check if an agent is legitimate by looking up their license status. In New York, real estate agents must be licensed, and you can verify their license through the New York State Department of State’s Division of Licensing Services website.\n\n\n\nJust enter their name or license number, and you’ll be able to see if they’re active and in good standing. It’s also a good idea to read reviews or ask for recommendations from friends or family who have had positive experiences. Trust your instincts—if something feels off, don’t hesitate to look for someone else. Good luck!",

            "selftext": "I was on the job boards a while back and saw an opening for a loan officer. I had the idea that I would try and test out getting leads first, prior to getting a LO license. It was a few months ago, that I got the idea to build a site, to have somewhere to store the leads and to make it easier to sell whatever leads I got since I couldnt do anything with the leads without an LO license. At most, I could use the proceeds to pay for the license? I completed the site a few days ago. The finished result allows for not only me but others to generate leads and be paid for the leads that are sold.\n\nI'm curious to know if any real estate agents would find this useful or if they would use this?\n\nI imagined the workflow to be straightforward:\n\nLeads for loan officers are created when a common inbound form is submitted by a prospect.\n\nA prospect gets to the form by clicking a hyperlink that was published on a agent/realtor's social media.\n\nAll the leads are viewable on one page for loan officers to purchase.\n\nWhen the LO buys the lead, the real estate agent gets paid. Additionally, when the LO successfully provides a mortgage service, the Loan Officer refers the prospect back to the real estate agent.\n\nVoilà! The realtor receives a prequalified referral. The LO has a new deal. To me, it seems like everyone wins? As a realtor or loan officer, I'm curious to know your thoughts, and if this would be something that would add value to you?",

                    "body": "Thank you for your response.  I've taken a while to complete this project, and like you, one of my initial concerns was FTC rules, what kind of business activity am I doing, what is a name given to my role as an in-between REAs and LOs.  I've met with lawyers and accountants to generate the 'terms of use' for the site.  Legally, because the links are pages of my website, the information obtained from the links (freely provided by prospects) are obtained by me, and the information becomes my property.  (quick pic of [the form](https://smittyleads.blogspot.com/2024/09/slf.html) by the way) When a link from my site is added to a social media link-in-bio/email/yard sign/...  of a real estate agent by a REA, the REA has merely 'published' my link.  When a Prospect fills out and submits my inbound form, the REA hasn't collected anything because the inbound form is my website.  The way it was put to me was: \"If you place a link to a roofer's landing page, which has an in bound form to get an inspection going, then because you linked to the roofer's inbound for doesn't mean that you've collected personal data; the roofer has collected the data.\"\n\nSo the initial prospect contact information starts with me.  I sell it to a loan officer.  Up to now, the only information shared has been between me and the loan officer.  At the sale, I pay a portion of that transaction to the REA. At this time, the REA has no idea who this prospect is.  They've likely never met or spoken with the prospect.  (quick pic of the [page where LOs can purchase leads](https://smittyleads.blogspot.com/2024/09/pt.html) from when I was testing/building the site)\n\nCaveat 1:  \nThe way I've programed the site is that only three times *max* will the prospect's information be sold to a loan officer, and then the personal information is auto deleted from my database.  Reason 1:  Too many sells to a loan officer makes the lead/product valueless; what if the LO is the 100th purchaser of a lead? then what's the point of my site?  Reason 2: no one wants a gazillion calls. If I want a service, a few calls is alright. I'd be upset if I were called all day, all week long.  So 3 is a decent number imo.\n\nWhen one of the three, or less, LOs successfully does whatever Loan Officers do with their clients, that LO will contact the REA who published the link.  I imagine that this makes LOs and REAs happy, as LOs *supposedly* routinely contact REAs with requests for clients. With my site, the LO calls the REA with an \"I have something for you.\" phone call.\n\nWith average homes prices the way they are, the \"I have something for you\" conversation is a few thousand dollar phone call.  At this point, the personal information would be transferred to the REA from the LO, or the LO advises the Client to call the REA (LO giving the client the REA's contact information).  Obtaining consent for sharing personal information from the LO to the REA would be the responsibility of the LO.\n\nWhen the prospect fills out my form, they are unable to submit the form without agreeing to their provided information being sold to a Loan Officer.  I ensure that only Loan Officers are purchasing from my site by requiring buyers to create an account, and when they create an account they must provide their NMLS ID.  Without an NMLS, they cant create an account; they cant purchase leads.\n\nCaveat 2:  \nLO referrals to REAs is only possible if the REA provides their call-back contact information.  My site doesn't require REAs to include their contact information to create an account on my site.  Once their account is created, then they can navigate to the page where they can add their call back information for LO to refer clients back to them.",

Using it to build a database is super useful.  \n  \nBut in order to go all out with a website you need to create content which takes a bit of time. And by content I mean stuff like blog posts about the local market, tips for buyers/sellers, or even community guides. Just some kind of lead-magnet that works for you even when you’re not actively working.\n\nIf you’re already using social media or running ads, your website is the end destination—a place to collect leads through forms, chatbots, or even the lead magnets above (you just have to ask them for their contact info to send them over the guidebook or whatever it may be.)\n\nLong story short, a website if done properly, could be the only driver of leads you'll ever need. Even if it’s a simple one-pager to start, having something up is better than nothing. It’s an investment that pays off big time in the long run. But there are many agents without websites that are incredibly successful as well and have their own strategies for lead-gen.",

I joined a team within my firm to try and help me get started properly. I wanted to jump start my career and was okay with a bigger split if that meant I could learn more. \n\n\n\n I'm posting on this page for insight on what exactly I should be getting out of being on a team. My team lead doesn't answer the phone most the time I call and need help with a problem. I don't get any leads from the team. The best advice I get to find new leads is to \"talk to as many people as possible\", which is a no brainer. Not really advice in my opinion. I am doing Open houses, social media engagement, cold calls, campaign drips, chatting within my sphere and networking events but nothing is happening. I'm sure its something simple I should work better at but I don't even get advice on this. \n\n\n\n We also have been doing booths which I think would be a great way to get more leads, but the way we do them are crazy to me. We try to promote the team (which is his name) by handing out merch the entire event. Instead of doing what I thought would be the best way to get new leads, \" do a raffle and get contact info\" we just hand out merch with our team name on it for \" brand awareness\". I'm simply posting this to get feedback from other agents and their experience on being a team. Is it pretty standard for it to be ran the way I'm attempting to explain my situation? \n\n  \nThank you!",

When I become an agent I joined a team and my contract stipulates that a certain number of my first deals have to be done as a team and that I get a smaller than usual cut of the commission. I'm fine with all of that.\n\nMy problem is that the team captain has given me some of his clients and listings to work on. One of them is a nail salon looking to expand. I've put in a ton of hours on it, finding properties, doing showings etc. mostly by myself. The owner of the salon set up a meeting with me and the team captain yesterday. At that meeting my captain was frankly rude to the owner, talking over them, interrupting them, raising his voice at them etc.. mind you the owner is someone I've been working with for weeks and get a long with very well. It ends with the owner walking out and my captain saying they are firing them as a client. \n\nI think my captain just cost me my commission and future business, but I am so new I don't have anywhere else to go. \n\nWhat should I do?",

I work as a Creative Manager for a real estate marketing and print firm, and I've seen how crucial good relationships and communication are in this industry. Here’s what I suggest:\n\n1. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed notes on your interactions with the salon owner and the work you've done. This will be useful if you need to discuss the situation with your team captain or others in your firm.\n2. **Talk to Your Captain**: Calmly express your concerns to your team captain about how the meeting was handled and the potential impact on your relationship with the client. Focus on your desire to learn and grow, and how this situation is affecting your progress.\n3. **Seek Guidance from a Mentor**: If there’s another experienced agent or mentor you trust in your firm, ask for their advice on handling this situation. They might offer insights on navigating team dynamics and dealing with difficult situations.\n4. **Build Your Own Network**: Start establishing your own network of clients and contacts. Attend local industry events, join online forums, and engage in community activities to build relationships independently of your team captain.\n5. **Learn from the Experience**: Take this as a learning opportunity. Reflect on what went wrong and think about how you would handle similar situations in the future.\n\nRemember, it’s a tough market but staying professional and focused on your long-term goals will pay off. Good luck!",

I've always wanted to be an agent, but right now, a full-time, 100% commission job isn't an option for me.\n\nCurrently, I work in tech sales and make around $80,000 a year. My schedule is pretty flexible, and my territory allows me to finish work by 2:30 PM. This flexibility makes me think I could manage real estate part-time until I build a strong enough client base to go full-time.\n\nHowever, I have some concerns. I live in the Pacific Northwest, where the market is quite saturated. Additionally, I haven't been here long (only 3 years), so I don't have a large network of contacts yet.\nThe good news is that I have years of experience in sales, including cold calling and prospecting. While I know nothing about real estate specifically, these transferable skills could be a major asset.\n\nA friend who's already a successful agent has also been encouraging me to pursue this path. Their success is definitely motivating!\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy wife and I bought our first home in the Bay Area in late 2022. It is in an old naval base that is being gentrified to add new housing. After we moved in, we noticed a lot of unsavory characters living in a new and decent looking apartment complex across the street. The police squad card are called in a weekly basis. There are still many  abandoned old military warehouse are on both side our block that we knew of. But at night, weirdos from that apartment and occasional homeless show up.   \n  \nSo about 3 weeks ago we found out that apartment was targeted for low income and a certain number of units to house formerly homeless. We also learned that 25% of our neighborhood must be zoned for low income for any new construction. Needless to say, other parts in our city (which only require 15%) are getting construction projects whereas there has been no development at all in our part of town since we moved. \n\nSo was there a responsibility on the real estate agent to inform us about these low income units across the street from us? Really agitated b/c I had told her that I did not want to even consider other properties for this reason. At the end of the day, I make the purchase, but I feel it was her responsibility to at least inform us of the neighborhood. This is the biggest purchase our lives and we kind of regret it which is a shitty feeling. Thoughts? ",

                    "body": "My guess (and it’s only a guess) is this. 2 things- first being this, their may very well be development in the pipeline for your area that is more than likely stalled given the unsavory lending environment for large construction projects right now. Compound that with an increased requirement for affordability and most developers are likely to just keep the permits in their back pocket until interest rates drop and the deal pencils out again. \n\nSecond would be- in most metropolitan areas the majority of larger multifamily development is permitted via special permits, this area being a former naval base leads me to assume their is likely an underlying industrial zoning, but their are avenues for development that developers can utilize to permit residential and/ or mixed use properties. But municipalities typically add in either affordability requirements as a requirement in these projects which are applied for via special permit vs projects that are by-right using underlying (non overlay) zoning. \n\nZoning is a touchy subject for real estate agents (remember, in most states their only required “education” per se is a 40 hour course), and zoning code is frequently dense and filled with information far more suited for a land use attorney to decipher and render an opinion/ summation of. Most good agents would likely err on the side of caution and not make an interpretation of zoning code as it has legal implications.  And as mentioned in another comment in the thread, real estate agents have a code of ethics which prohibits them from engaging in redlining etc based on income of surrounding residents. \n\nMy advice- reach out to the planning office in the city and see if there are any active permits for the surrounding properties. Your more than likely not losing any value in the asset you purchase right now, and knowing what is in the pipeline for the area may put your mind at ease; and could be great information to use in marketing your property if you ever go to sell it ( in my experience People buying into neighborhoods going through gentrification/ transition love to feel like their getting in early on the “potential” of the neighborhood).",

If you're just starting I know it can be a little overwhelming as it's a lot of information. \n\nEverybody is different when it comes to effective techniques for actually absorbing the information that is being presented. Some people like to make flashcards, some can just pick up a book and read it, or mark it up with highlighter. I personally like to watch a video or online presentation that I can pause and rewind as needed with someone talking and I'll take notes. I take very detailed notes, that I necessarily will ever actually read, ironically. I find that with me writing down a sentence it gives me the time to reflect on what the instructor said and put my notes in my own words to fully breakdown and understand what is being taught. Then I just hit the practice exams when I have went through all the material. \n\nIn NYS our real estate license salesperson course is 75 hours, I took my time and completed it in 79 hours. I have been in real estate for 11 years but, on the finance side. I also have some carpentry experience and education under my belt as well, so it defiantly made it a little easier for me with knowing some terms and calculations for financing, ect.\n\nMy advise ultimately, find what works best for you. Although we have said you may not NEED to retain much of the information long term, it doesn't hurt to be able to fully understand it regardless. Nothing on there is going to hurt your career in real estate if you DO know it. Don't rush through and use whatever method you find easiest to learn and retain information. I'm sure you will do fine on the test, and I wish you luck!",

Other subs heavily moderate anything that may be considered commercial, but we take a softer approach. Most agents need to invest in their business (whether it's directly with paid ads, lead generation tools, or even indirectly to brokers as part of a team.\n\nALL AGENTS WELCOME\n\nYou don't need to be a member of the National Association of Realtors to join - all topics useful to real estate agents are welcome.",

I work full time and have been the only one in our family working for the past six years. My wife's income will just be extra spending money. As a way to build some contacts and her reputation she is planning to offer a five hundred dollar gift card to the first ten customers who purchase a home. My question is whether you all think that is a reasonable amount or not? Should she offer more or less or does it really make a difference? The average house in my area is selling for 146,000. And again, in the beginning she is not as worried about how much money she will be making as she is about building a clientele.",

Rather than advertising a gift card as a selling point she can give them maybe a nice housewarming gift after the fact. Just so we have an idea of how long is \"a long time without spending money\", on average would you say 6 months to a year? She will be focusing on this full time and we are willing to make any sacrifices needed in order to get established. Also do you have any idea how many houses the average full time real estate agent sells in a month or year? How long have you been a real estate agent? How long did it take you to get established?",

We pay our guy $125. It only takes him about an hour to put up and another hour to take them down so hourly he's making good money and it's easy to find someone to do this. Also, our preferred lender pays half of this cost in our commitment to providing buyer leads to them from the Open House. So it's not a big expense and is a huge selling point in our listing consult.

Would you find this app useful? (See below for more info about the app)\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter\n\n------------\nHere's a little bit about me and the app:\n\nI developed this app as a result of a tennant completely trashing my property which we rented out via a management team and vowed never to let this happen again. So Inspctr was developed allowing you to primarily take a series of photographs of each room using the app as well as rate and record the condition of specific areas and items, all done quickly and easily.\n\nFor people living remotely from their property and those relying on cleaners or management team to maintain the high standards you set, this app has proved to be a huge success with my own tests I've carried out. Periodically my management team quickly carry out a walk-around inspection, press submit and I receive an email with a link to view the digital report containing a professional document collating all the inspection findings and all the photos. This photo feature is extremely useful as I can see for myself the exact state my property is in, without taking somebody else's word for it.\n\nThis is something I'm hugely passionate about as it has been built with my own experiences in mind. I'd really appreciate it if anybody on here would be willing to become a beta tester and use the app before it launches, for free of course.\n\nThank you and best wishes,\n\nPeter",
