To get noticed, like the 2 most recent photos and also comment on it letting them know to check their DM.\n\n- If you were going after clients on LinkedIn, you would need to use an automation tool that allows you to send 80 connection requests per day with messaging sequences on auto-pilot. The one that I use is called We-Connect. You'll also need Sales Navigator for it as well.\n\nIt's super competitive out there, so your messaging and offer need to be powerful and different. Trainers and Course Creators are two different avatars. I would focus on only one to narrow it down.\n\nCase studies are also important. Do you have results to share?\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to be the person you, yourself would buy from. The standards shouldn't lower because you're the one selling. Your competitors are sending a ridiculous amount of cold messages (and also probably running paid ads). You need to step it up!",

I'm not going to give away the secret sauce, but I am going to shed some light on what you MUST do as a debt relief company to get more enrollments in 2024. This is because I have seen a lot of questions across Reddit without any answers.\n\nNow, most of you either run direct mail campaigns or pay per call with a publisher. While that may keep you afloat, that market is quickly becoming saturated and it's no secret that those methods are going downhill fast.\n\nThe future is digital. Now, you may have tried digital already and it didn't work. What you need to understand that digital is not a \"strategy.\" Digital is a channel. Within the digital channel lies an unlimited amount of strategies- which means you didn't even really try.\n\nSo now that we've established you need to go digital, let's touch on a few KPI's you should be expecting. If your CPL is above $15, you're failing. If you're below that, but you're running Facebook Lead Forms, you are failing. What you should aim for is long-form to an (off facebook) Landing Page conversions at $6 - $15 CPL. \n\nOnce you've cracked that code, the next step is to make sure you're utilizing SMS. Since A2P 10DLC came out, most of you guys can't get registered since you have the word \"debt\" in your name. That doesn't mean you should just give up and not use SMS. You MUST use SMS if you're going to get your cost per new enrollment down. We have our own methods of getting anyone approved, so it is possible.\n\nThat first SMS is key after you've generated the lead. The main goal of any SMS campaign should be getting a RESPONSE. What's funny is that I often have conversations with businesses using SMS and I ask them what they say in the first text message. They say; \"Well we just send a confirmation text.\" The issue with this is, how can you expect someone to reply to a confirmation text when you're making a statement and not asking a question. That is why I always like to add a \"sound good?\" to the first text. The goal is to get a response, because one you get engagement- the higher the probability you will get that person on the phone. You will not make an enrollment without getting them on the phone (obviously).\n\nCircling back to the landing page- What most publishers do is just send you leads/traffic and don't care whether or not you make the sale because they've made their money already. They aren't incentivized to make things harder for themselves. The benefit of using long form on a landing page is that you get to ask extra questions that give your sales rep more information to get the deal closed. Building trust and rapport is huge in this industry- so anything extra your sales rep can speak about outside of their crippling debt is a massive advantage. This is a conversation that you would never hear an old school publisher speak about. They have never been on a sales call in their entire lives.\n\nAnyway- Of course there's some more to it, but this will definitely help you in your pursuit towards a predictable stream of debt relief leads. Best part about digital is that you can turn up the volume as you go. I would say you should budget for about $5K in ad spend per sales rep- As from what we've seen one rep can handle that without issue. \n\nCost per new enrollments should be anywhere between $300 - $400 if you're doing it right- this is what we're getting.\n\nMoral of the story is to not give up on digital. Obviously I threw in a few results that we've been getting to incentivize some of you to reach out. As of right now- we don't need a long list of clients since everyone in this industry has capital to scale vertically but if it fits, it fits. Good luck!\n\n[https://10xdebt.com](https://10xdebt.com)",

I've been there, too.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n1️⃣ **Businesses ALWAYS need clients**\n\nEvery business sells something and they need customers to buy it. If you can bring them clients, they’ll just run the numbers about how much will they make out of it and make a deal with you. \n\nYou are essentially helping them to make money. It’s one of the most valuable and timeless skills you can have.\n\n***One note here:***\n\nThe  closer you can tie the impact of your service to the client’s bottom  line (profit) the more you can charge because you will be able to  display how much value you brought to them.\n\n>\"If I bring you **30 leads** and you end up **making $200k**, would you mind **paying me $20k**?\"\n\n**2️⃣ It’s a universal business skill**\n\nThink about it. Once you've cracked the code for generating leads in one industry, you've essentially learned a formula. \n\nWith minor tweaks and adjustments, **you can apply this formula across various industries**. Also, you will know how to **generate your own customers** for any venture you launch **for the rest of your life**.\n\n3️⃣ **AI is a game-changer**\n\nWith the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Lead Generation is becoming **more precise** (lets you generate more money for your clients) and **easier to deliver** (faster and cheaper on your end) which means it’s **easier to sell** which means you make more $$$.\n\nGuys, I am telling you... Lead Generation is the easiest way to start your own agency and get quick results! \n\nOf course you need to **put in the work and take action**, but it doesn't require you learning a completely new skill that's not complementary to what you're already doing.\n\nHope this gives you some clarity!",

The features that are being added are suddenly making it that much easier for regular people to generate leads on their own.\n\nFor example, there are now plug-ins like UpHex for GoHighLevel that allow someone with no experience to launch and manage their own facebook and google ads with only 5-clicks. Since GHL allows you to white-label its software, people are able to sell marketing software with ad launch capabilities as their own and are also able to sell it under the guise of AI, since now GHL also has that feature.\n\nThe beauty of it is that the cost is so low to now start a \"saas company\" because you're doing zero development and are basically selling white-labeled saas, letting other people come up with new plug-in features and can either sell it all together at a premium or make it the ultimate saas downsell for any agency.\n\nIt's definitely a big opportunity and it's still pretty early.

I run a digital marketing and web design agency focused on helping businesses boost their online visibility and attract high-quality leads. I’m especially interested in sharing and learning about actionable strategies for lead generation, like effective SEO and content marketing, and I’ve been exploring podcast guesting as a way to expand reach.\n\nOne tactic I’ve had success with is using MatchMakerfm for podcast outreach, which has led to some great client inquiries and partnerships. It’s a bit of a different route, but it’s worked wonders for positioning myself as a trusted resource in the industry.\n\nIf anyone’s curious about the step-by-step approach I used, I made a YouTube video explaining it all! Just DM me, and I’d be happy to share the link. Looking forward to learning from everyone here and sharing insights to help us all grow!",
