Also Paganism is a loose term. The gods and traditions often varied village by village with different gods taking precedent at different times. \n\nAlso Egypt for a brief period had a monotheistic cult around the sun god Aten which is known as  Atenism.

However, it was basically persecuted wherever it went and never really had any sort of state backing. It also was probably too syncretic for its own good and probably got absorbed into local traditions across its range rather than supplanting them. \n\nThe religion became completely extinct in the medieval era, with the last practitioners somewhere in southern China but there are controversial claims that there are maybe some surviving practitioners of descendent traditions.\n\nAlso, worth mentioning is the old Vedic religion/tradition. This was the sort of religion/culture in ancient India. From it emerged Jainism and Buddhism which actually nearly possibly replaced it. The old Vedic religion actually ended up developing and absorbing the cool bits of the other religions and reappearing as what we now call Hinduism. \n\nNow Jainism is much reduced from its ancient days and Buddhism at one point was virtually extinct itself in India, surviving and becoming a major force in east Asia.",

In the western end of the silk road, the orthodox church and the abbassids persecuted it as heresy.  On the Eastern end, the Tang Dynasty allowed foreigners to practice it but it was illegal for Chinese to convert.  The Uighur  vassal state was Manichaen and the Chinese state used them as mercenaries.  This continued under the Yuan.  So when the Ming took over it had to go and was declared a heretical sect of Buddhism.  The rest just got absorbed.  \n\nFrom being everywhere in the civilized world to nowhere is pretty crazy.",

Chinese worshippers called Mani “Moni, the Buddha of Light” and the religion Mingjiao (“the religion of light”). \n\nManicheanism entered China due to trade and began to gain popularity in the Song and Tang dynasty. However, it was branded as a suspicious foreign sect by Emperor Wuzong of Tang and suppressed along with many other foreign faiths including Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and Nestorian Christianity. The Manichean religion continued to be practiced and spread clandestinely by followers who pretended to be Buddhists or Taoists. Over time many secret Manichean temples’ origins were forgotten and were treated as Buddhist or Daoist temples by the population at large but these temples still retained certain peculiarly Manichean features.\n\nThere is one Manichean temple called Cao’an that is still intact and open to visitors in Jinjiang, Fujian province. There is a statue of Mani in the temple which looks almost like a Buddha but has straight hair and a beard. He also look straight at the worshipper instead of down like normal Buddha statues and doesn’t do the Buddhist mudrā hand gesture. There is an inscription (a replica of the original destroyed during the Cultural Revolution) that reminds worshippers of the Manichean virtues of Purity (清净), Light (光明), Power (大力), and Wisdom (智慧). Even today there are Chinese people who will make offerings to Mani and conduct certain rituals of Chinese Manichean origin.",

I guess I'm wondering, to what extent is it a tradition or an inspiring story and to what extent is it a set of literal propositions about the nature of the universe? Do Neo-Pagans view Paganism more the way someone like Billy Graham views Christianity or is it more the John Shelby Spong attitude? Or does it vary?",

                    "body": "Lots of religions are ethnic religions like the Druze or Judaism (which does accept converts but has high barriers) or Yazidism, that doesn’t mean they are on their way out. Lots of religions are specifically only designed for a specific culture. Universal religions that try to convert everyone regardless of culture is in the minority.\n\nAnd it’s only the Parsis in India who practice endogamy because it’s an ethno-religious group. They are descendants of Persian refugees who settled in India back in the 8th-10th centuries following the Arab conquest of Persi. The community decided to only marry among each other to keep their cultural and religious identity pure. It’s a conscious choice to prevent themselves from getting absorbed by Muslim or Hindu communities. Not marrying out is not part of the religion per se, it’s part of Farsi culture.\n\nIranian Zoroastrianism on the other never veered away from its universalist roots. They accept converts and can marry outside the faith. It’s just the Iranian government isn’t very accepting of non-Islamic faiths and prevent people from converting from Islam. Zoroastrianism is legal in Iran though and has an official census figure of about 25,000 (unofficial estimates are higher). Also there’s been a recent trend of Zoroastrian conversion in Iraqi Kurdistan as a way for Kurds to distinguish themselves from the Arab neighbours.\n\nThe Parsi community in India only number under 60,000 but they are very powerful and influential, in large part due to endogamy keeping wealth in their families. They are extremely well educated on average and had long formed part of the Indian professional class and merchant class with a long history of impressive philanthropy. They’ve made an outsized contribution to Indian society in every sector, they are like Ashkenazi Jews in European history but from the position of being even more of a minority. \n\nSome notable Parsi include several early independence activists like Sir Pherozeshah Mehta who confounded the Indian National Congress back in 1890, another early INC president Dadabhai Naoroji, Madam Bhikaiji Cama who raised the first Indian national flag abroad. The two fathers of the Indian nuclear program Homi J. Bhabha and Homi Sethna are both Farsi. Many prominent generals and admirals and air chiefs are also of Parsi descent. Lots of great cricketers were Parsi, like Farokh Engineer and Nari Contractor. The celebrated postcolonial scholar and critical theorist Homi K. Bhabha is a Parsi too and the Indian Canadian novelist Rohinton Mistry is a Farsi who writes a lot about his community.\n\nThere are many Parsi entertainers too: Freddie Mercury (Farrokh Bulsara) was a Parsi whose funeral was a cremation conducted by a Zoroastrian priest, the composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, world famous conductor Zubin Mehta, and Bollywood actor Boman Irani. One of the earliest film producers and distributors in India was a Farsi, Jamshedji Framji and his great-great grandson is American actor Erick Avari who’s in Stargate. The British comedian Nina Wadia was in the sketch show Goodness Gracious Me and the soap opera Eastenders among other things. She’s a member of the influential Wadia family and married to a fellow Parsi. The father of contemporary Thai cinema Rattana Pestonji was also a Parsi.\n\nSome of the richest old money Indian families are Parsi: Tata, Godrej, Mistrys, Wadia (first became super rich by building ships for the East India Company in the 1700s), Poonwalla, and the Petits who are also British Baronets. These families make up most of India’s billionaires and richest people despite being less than 0.06% of the total population. They aren’t to marry outside their faith but some do anyways; the founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah was married to a Petit and Tata heiress, Rattanbai Petit, and his only child Dina Jinnah married a Wadia heir. Their son Nusli Wadia is the chairman of the Wadia Group and a multi-billionaire. \n\nThe first Indian PM Nehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi, who also later became PM herself, married a Parsi man Feroze Gandhi. So the Nehru-Gandhi political family that still rules over the INC party is of Farsi ancestry, though not recognized as part of the community due to mixed ancestry. Sometimes they make special exceptions for mixed marriages and allow children of those marriages to be raised in the Zoroastrian faith, like for Dina Jinnah’s children, but these cases are rare.",

Some went to war over religion, some over territorial disputes or a disputed inheritance, others because they wanted revenge for losing a previous war.\n\nBut some wars are fought over things that are just absurd from the perspectives of today. I'll start with mentioning an obvious one: the Confederate States of America seceded from the Union because they feared that the federal government of the United States would move to end the institution of slavery. \n\nThere were other reasons as well, but slavery was the driving factor across the South, for both the slave-owning planter elite who feared the loss of a cheap and subservient source of labor, and poorer Southern whites who feared a hypothetical race war with the newly freed slaves, as well as African Americans competing for jobs. Even with these rationalizations, such as they are, I struggle to think of a cause that was less worth fighting for than keeping millions of people in chains.\n\nAny causes for war that were on an equal level of absurdity, or perhaps even more absurd?\n\nEdit: To clarify, I'm asking for both absurd and particularly immoral reasons to go to war. I realize that 'worst' can be a bit broad.",

Yes really. \n\n- **Falklands War:**  Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands because their dictator was unpopular and thought Britain would roll over and let it happen. Margaret Thatcher of course summons half the Royal Navy and annihilates the Argentinians keeping the islands half way around the world.   \n\n- **Saddam’s Invasion of Kuwait:** Iraq fails to win the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s and racks up huge debts in the process. Saddam invades Kuwait to capture oil fields and to reinforce his power and promptly destroyed by a UN coalition force which annihilates his army. \n\n- **The Pastry War:** A French pastry chef complained to the French King when his store was looted in Mexico City in 1832 and demanded 60,000 Pesos as reparations (his store was worth less then 1,000). France demanded Mexico pay 600,000 Pesos which Mexico of course refused. This led to the French Invasion of Mexico in 1838 and a subsequent invasion in 1860. \n\n- **Opium Wars:** China was trying to stop Britain from getting its citizens hooked on Opium and the British fought two wars in order to keep selling Chinese opium. Essentially Britain told China they were gonna keep buying their drugs and like it, China said no so Britain bombed the shit outta them twice and kept selling them drugs.",

I know Dachau was originally for political prisoners but it was for the same purpose of eventually extermination. The Nazi’s no doubt went to war with the Soviet Union and Poland to claim lands in Eastern Europe the planned on filling with German settlers, wiping out the ethnic groups already there in the process but this doesn’t explain why they invaded France and the Western Allies (they declared war on Hitler for invading Poland yes) but do note these were the powers that forced Versailles upon Germany, they were going to eventually be attacked sooner or later. I also will say even if Germany only took minimal lands in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland they were gonna still kill all the Jews and other “undesirables” within Germany eventually as Western nations began to limit how many they would take in.",

Today you learn in school that lightning is about electricity in nature. 4000 years ago lightning was the sky father being upset. They didn't have a theory of electricity. They didn't understand air pressure or ionization or discharge or how they worked. They still explained it in a away that made sense to them. Why is the ocean there? What is a cave? Why does it exist? Who created that?\n\nA body of these explanations if myth.\n\nDoes myth derive from historical persons or events? Honestly I think historians, archeologists, and related fields do not like this question and it's disliked because it puts the fields in an impossible position of trying to explain, control, or clarify 'maybes.'\n\nMaybes are bullshit. Maybes, without evidence, is basically just making shit up.\n\nAre there historical persons or events in myths (and legends)? Maybe. Troy is a real place. Gilgamesh is generally accepted to have been a real king. Eight Deer and Ce Actl Topiltzin are generally taken to be legendary figures based on a historical personage.\n\nBut 'maybes' are bullshit in this regard. Without evidence, maybe is basically making shit up and getting bogged down in the 'maybes' of the past can take us very far from anything even remotely factual. So different academics get very uncomfortable with questions with a 'maybe' answer because 'maybe' can mean just about anything and everything between fact and fiction and that's not very useful.\n\n'Maybe' while technically possible, is not scientific. More than that, it's a distraction with the possibility to poison actual evidence in search of a romantic conclusion. You'll find different scholars have different comfort levels with 'maybe.'",

We carried beliefs and superstitions with us out of Africa and into Fertile Crescent. Some people carried variations and mutations of those beliefs with them as they wandered into Europe or across Eurasia and into the South Pacific or across the Bering Land Bridge into the Americas. The beliefs we carried with us changed over time, mutated with the retelling, changed by the availability of resources or access to certain lands. Some people combined different ideas to create new beliefs and those carried on in the wandering and the morphing over time. We didn't spontaneously invent superstition 8000 times, we are just superstitious creatures and that's always been part of our story.",

As others have pointed out, the imperial title wasn't inherited, and plenty of men claimed by force of arms. Mehmet II did the same, and after conquering Constantinople (Kostantiniyye), he called himself Qeyser-i-Rûm, aka Caesar of Rome. Over the centuries, his descendents emphasized this claim less and less, but they never dropped it altogether. You can consider them illigitimate usurpers if you want (and IMO the Ottoman state isn't really the same as the Roman Empire), but there's nothing legally saying they can't take the Roman throne. Since the Ottoman state doesn't exist anymore, we could consider the throne vacant until Pope Francis decides to crown a Frenchman or something\n\nEdit: words",

Their royal legitimacy came from Piedmont-Sardinia conquering or absorbing the rest of Italy, though of course a lot of people throughout italy wanted them to do just that.\n\nAs for Austria, it depends on how much you buy the \"Holy Roman Empire was the continuation of the Western Roman Empire\" idea. I've never bought it personally, but the Holy Roman Emperors did always claim the connection, elected their emperors, and used the title \"King of the Romans\". There's an argument to be made. Either way, the HRE was officially disbanded by the Hapsburgs as part of the formation of the Austrian Empire, I'm not sure how that would affect their claims.",

The longest sea journey between islands would be  bout 3 days, and you can store enough water for that in gourds. There was an extinction of Mega Fauna about 46 Kya in Australia. There was another extinction around 42-43 Kya but that has been linked to climate change and the drying up of lakes and wetlands. \n\nThey didn't cross the Pacific by raft. \n\nSome travelled  from SE Asia into NE Asia and either across the Land Bridge and inland around the Ice Sheet, which was possible from 19Kya.  Or they could have rafted down the South Coast of Alaska/Canada avoiding the Ice Sheet that way, but any trace of that journey is underwater now. Then they walk into South America and the Amazon Basin. \n\nNew Zealand which was settled c. 1300 is regarded as the last large land mass settled by humans. Which means they had about 100 years of roasting giant chickens.",

How many people still believe Paul McCartney isn't the original Paul McCartney?\n\nBut for a more historical example, there is a section in Dostoevsky' The Brothers Karamozov that addresses the phenomenon. \n\nThere's an old sage in the novel named Father Zosima, and one of the novel's protagonists becomes a student of his. Eventually, Father Zosima is dying and there's like a hundred pages of his deathbed sermons. \n\nOne of the sections in the sermon is all about how the light of truth needs to reach to the ignorant and impoverished masses, or else we are all going to pay the price. \n\nTo illustrate this, he basically says that right now the poor live in a completely different universe from the people who are ruling them. He tells a story about a peasant revolt that he remembers happening in Russia when he was much younger. He says that all these peasants got together and started massacring landowners, and fiercely resisting the authorities' attempts to stop them. \n\nFather Zosima remembers that during the revolt, all the academics and intelligent people were speculating as to why it was happening. They were talking about economic inequality, the terrible quality of recent harvests, the disloyalty of this new generation to the institutions of the past, etc., etc.\n\nAfter the revolt was finally crushed, it came out that the peasant rebels believed the Tsar of Russia had been killed by greedy aristocrats because he was standing up for the peasants' rights. They believed this aristocratic conspiracy then replaced the real Tsar with a Jewish lookalike who would help the aristocrats continue to exploit the peasants and drive them further into poverty and dependence. \n\nFather Zosima said the intelligentsia of the day was absolutely flabbergasted by this. \n\nSo, while economic factors certainly played a role - ignorance and conspiracy theories are what made the revolt so passionate and violent. Father Zosima believed that the people running society needed to do a much better job of educating the poor and keep them engaged with how society is actually run, in order to nip these sorts of things in the bud. \n\nSo while I'm not sure the old switcharooski has ever really happened - there have definitely been countless times in which people have been convinced it happened.",

Mao was never going to accept that one of his major programs was a disaster so he soldiered on despite knowing of immense suffering.\n\nStalin is so much more complicated. One major reason for the way the Holodomor turned was because of Stalin's (not just him though) intense distrust of Ukraine which he thought was full of Polish spies...and he was correct! Post-Stalin a lot has been confirmed about Polish infiltration of Ukraine between the Polish-Soviet War and WWII he wasn't entirely wrong. Stalin of course thought it was worse than it was though, and as a result initially disbelieved what Ukrainian's were claiming was going on there thinking it was a Polish plot, it wasn't. So initially it was mismanagement and scepticism but eventually when it became clear it was extremely bad it became more intentional for debated reasons. Some think he still thought it was a Polish plot thinking they had intentionally destabilized the region to make Stalin look bad and to drain Soviet resources. Others think he decided to cleanse region and essentially rebuild it with people he could trust. If it's the latter then there's no debate about it being Genocide, if it's the former it is more debateable. \n\nThat's not even going into people like Stalin's paranoia coming from their lives before they came to power. The Okhrana is largely forgotten but it was fucking terrifying at the time to people like Stalin, they were absolutely winning similar to The Troubles in Ireland they had massively infiltrated rebel groups like Stalin's which resulted in Stalin constantly being in jail or exile (unlike Lenin and Trotsky who were living comfortably in Europe, he remained in Russia throughout) stewing about all the people who obviously betrayed him then WWI happened and they found an avenue to power. Before that they were clearly losing though and it's true that they had no idea who was an ally and who was an Okhrana double agent. He lived a Cold War before WWI, the Russian Revolution, the Soviet-Polish War, WWII and the early Cold War he led.",

Availability of natural resources is only important geopolitically, as a strategic asset, that's it.\n\nThe US got as rich as it is because it has had very robust economic freedoms and very developed markets for a very long time. As did European economies, even if that's not as much the case anymore.\n\n>Which small government economy is thriving ?\n\nSwitzerland, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore...\n\nBtw you mentioned Singapore in another comment among countries with high government spending, when Singapore has one of the smallest states in the world.\n\nAll that said, the absolute size of the state is not the only factor, and I don't know why you fixated only on that reading my comment. But in the case of Argentina it is definitely a major factor along with public policies, and it's also a major factor in the stagnation that Europe and Japan suffer.",

There were some scripts during Muhammad’s life but not the full book. \n\nSimple answer: Muhammad or if you’re Muslim, God wrote it and revealed it to Muhammad through an angel Gabriel. \n\n2. Early conversions in Mecca then higher conversions in Medina leading to a mass Muslim migration to Medina, threats of violence/war, and eventually Mecca was conquered leading to mass (forced) conversions\n\n3. The Byzantine and Sassanids had long been involved in wars of their owns significantly weakening them. The Muslims also had great military strategists, like Khalid ibn Waleed.\n\n4.

It's remarkable to me that someone like that existed, every stage of his life seems ridiculous. \n\nLBJ went to an incredibly poor College that was not where the big wigs in Texas typically went. Today it's Texas State University, at the time it was Southwest Texas State Teachers College. When he showed up no one cared about Student Politics at all, Elections were a formality the popular kids athletes, and members of the big social clubs would simply be voted in and barely any votes would be cast. They had no power and barely anyone even knew who was President or whatever because it was so meaningless.\n\nThen LBJ turns up and is rejected for one of those social clubs so he goes on the warpath. He quickly turns Student Politics into the most important thing in the College, he doesn't make himself a major candidate instead he essentially makes himself the puppetmaster of his Party which is one of the lesser Social Clubs that his roommate did get him into but severely regretted. His behaviour was awful but it's straight up farcical how nasty student politics at this small ass college got. People were being accused of being gay and lesbian or having abortions which was obviously not good for your image in 1920s Texas. LBJ would have people told the wrong time for a debate then he'd have his candidate on stage saying how little his opponent obviously cares about the school. I swear that's straight out of the Simpsons episode where Homer runs for Trash Commissioner, that's what this reminds me of. \n\nThe funniest thing about it all to me is very few people (his roommate was one) realized that LBJ was behind it all because he wasn't a major candidate and he was very much behind the scenes. So he turned all of these people viciously against each other and turned this peaceful little School into the Late Roman Republic all because he got rejected for a stupid club.",

He then instructed his diplomats to try to get them to withdraw their declarations of war, essentially asking \"are you sure you really need this right now?\".

This lead to terrible conditions for the soldiers, wasted supplies and gunpowder and rampart starvation.  IIRC from one of the books I read, a group left early because the trip took longer than their contract and Arnold didn't have any money to pay them.  Of the 1100 soldiers he set out with, only 600 remained by the time he reached Quebec City to attack the fortified town whose troops outnumbered him 2 to 1.",

In most countries, you must reach a certain age to be allowed to drink alcohol, however there is a curious loophole in British law, based on the legal basis that anything not specifically banned is permitted. The law bans people under 18 from buying alcohol, and drinking in a public location, but it does not ban them from owning alcohol or drinking in private. So where is the limit? Well it turns out that this is covered under an old law that determines that giving alcohol to anyone under 5 is child abuse and is thus illegal, making 5 the legal drinking age in the uk",

Described as singing the Song of Roland and juggling his sword, he charged out ahead of his fellow Normans and defeated an Englishman in single combat. Thrilled by this, he galloped headlong into the English lines alone and was- one imagines quite matter of factly- cut to pieces immediately. \n\nIt’s really funny to me how some individuals achieve an immortal legacy through their idiocy. Here I am 1000 years later talking about Taillefer, the only other people I can name from that battle are William the Conqueror and Harold Godwinson!",

What began as a dispute over stolen property between a peasant from one jurisdiction and a burgess from another became a major regional conflict requiring the arbitration of King Philip III of France, who ordered the restoration of the status quo ante bellum in 1278.[1]\nThe cause of the war was the theft of a cow by a peasant during a jousting tournament in the city of Ciney, regional capital of Condroz. The thief, Engorant de Jalhay, was caught and ordered to pay a fine (to avoid death) and return the cow. The bailiff's men mistakenly executed the peasant anyway, and the peasant's lord demanded recompense.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Cow)",

It was extremely tumultuous as both were proud people coming into the power from the apex of the European hierarchy. Their relationship was difficult, full of passion and loathing. John was warrior king educated and cultured in France. Elizabeth was Bohemian queen living in rural seclusion and only had noble title and possible wealth of the Bohemian kingdom behind her. She was jealous and passionate at the same time. The marriage was full of fights followed by make-up sex and reconciliation. Elizabeth was not cultivated in court etiquette so she was easy to get railed up and fought physically with her royal husband. Then they had reconciliation. During one of the spousal argument, Elizabeth beat the king and knocked the wind out of him. John failed deflecting the blows. The marriage fell apart as John never forgave his humiliation (he died in battle of Crecy in 1346). After her death, he married French noblewomen  from the House of Bourbon.",

The Means of Ascent (The shortest, the other three are around the same size this is about 60% or something of them. Largely focuses on his ridiculous 1948 successful Senate Election, 1941-1948.\n\n03. The Master of the Senate (My favourite. Covers his first decade in the Senate: 1948-1958. Shows how he not only became Senate Majority Leader absurdly early considering positions like that were only gained through seniority at the time, but also gave it power as before Lyndon it was essentially the lightening rod for the real powers the Committee Chairmans. Ends with him passing the first Civil Rights Act since just after the Civil War some 90 years earlier, it's an incredible story and the intro chapter that describes the Senate's history gives me goosebumps.)\n\n04. The Passage of Power (Covers the end of his time in the Senate, his 1960 Presidential Election attempt, his time as VP, JFK's Assassination and him finishing JFK's term as President.\n\nHe's not even got seriously into Vietnam yet.",

Of course, goblins have taken over the castle and you need to clear them out.\n\nI'm wondering is this a particularly common thing? Were there often castles throughout history that just didn't have someone to govern them? What circumstances would lead to this? I'm guessing in the real world, such a vacancy would be a reward for service to the crown instead of the manufactured storyline in the game.\n\nEdit: I should clarify my intent here. When I say residents, I specifically mean noble residents appointed by some higher authority, not merely the upkeep. Although, interestingly enough that was present in the game, as the local butler was the only survivor of the goblins that overtook it. And while goblins do not exist in real life, I suppose there certainly were plenty of people who would have been happy to band together and take an under-defended castle if they thought they could get away with it or leverage it into a ransom or something.",

It might be that previous owner of the castle's right to own it expired with their death, or perhaps it could have been inherited but there were nobody claimed it, or it was seized by an outside party that fell out of the previous jurisdiction (even before the goblins came).

Or maybe it could be legal for certain dukes to entitle people, or just in that area, or whatever.",

Happened about 10:35ish at night, South Australian time, and happen right after the TV show, West Wing finished being aired that night. Seeing events like that live on TV are not something you can just forget. Also a few of us went in balls deep with some of the 9/11 truth movement at the time. Some harder then the others. I even know someone in highschool that was a stunner, with a bit of a trouble home life, cleaned him self up, and joined the Australian Army, and did a few tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. From what I remember. He told me that it was  9/11 that made him to get clean and short him self out so he could join.

If you're taking a broad \"US History\" class, it's probably going to skip over some stuff. Not because it didn't *matter*, but because a semester is only so long and you can't cover everything in the detail it deserves. You probably spent a week or two on the Civil War, but if you get detailed enough, you can spend an entire semester on only the runup to and events of the Civil War, without even getting to Reconstruction. If you're specifically studying the history of right wing extremism in the United States, Waco and Oklahoma City would for sure be major focuses.\n\nThe thing about history is that, when you get down to it, almost nothing is really \"unimportant\". The butterfly effects of seemingly unconnected events that happened on opposite sides of the world and came together centuries later to change the world is mind boggling. There are layers and layers to every subject under the sun.",

If I only have 15 weeks to cover about 400 years in history, these events are not nearly as important as any I listed above (just off the top of my head). Also, these events are still relatively recent. A US History class may not have enough time to get here or steer clear of them because of how divisive they are today.",

                    "body": "America got quite lucky.\n\nIt was able to declare Independence at a time when the UK had bigger problems to deal with, so had a very easy time becoming a sovereign state. It was then sold a good chunk of land by Napoleon which was French only in name, a great bit of much needed cash for France for what was essentially just New Orleans + a claim.\n\nThis allowed America to expand rapidly westward without getting into a conflict with a major power like the French. Even better, the only other major power that was present in the Americas at the time which wasn't the UK, was Spain. The U.S deliberately avoided confrontation with the UK from 1812 onwards and the UK avoided confrontation with the U.S, focusing more on the east. Spain was very weak, corrupt and its empire was falling apart. By virtue of being the first independent state of any sort of size in the Americas, and surrounded by colonial empires that were largely indifferent to them (Britain/France/Netherlands) and those which were decrepit (Spain/Portugal) the only real confrontation they faced was from the natives, over whom they had a massive technological advantage.\n\nFurthermore, the Industrial revolution started in Britain in the late 18th century and continued through the 19th. The U.S primarily used English as the language of government and fell into the Anglosphere whilst still being independent, this meant that new ideas and information from the UK was spread quite fast in the new world amongst Americans compared to elsewhere. Likewise due to having become independent, America was free to structure its own economy and actually implement these ideas unlike for example within the Imperial domain which was a protected system designed for Britain to export goods to favourable markets. \n\nDue to its geography and geopolitical circumstances, America did not face a threat from another non-native power that could have any sort of existential threat from 1812 to 1941, and even then 1941 is being extremely generous to the Japanese. Realsitically only the Soviets ever have and mostly due to ICBMs. \n\nWhilst American did have had troubles with emerging colonial countries like Mexico, these states had spent a lot longer under Spanish rule than America had under British rule. The British system was also a lot better than the Spanish one, which was corrupt and inefficient. Their successor states suffered from many of the same issues, whilst those states which were settled by the British were largely quite successful. This meant that American was able to dominate the countries of Latin America fairly easily economically and politically.\n\nAmerica was also able to attract a lot of immigration from Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, for many the circumstances in America and the \"free\" land which could be acquired from the natives was extremely appealing as conditions in much of 19th and early 20th Europe were not ideal. This meant that American population was able to grow rapidly from both high birth rates and incoming immigration from relatively similar cultures who either already spoke English, or usually had a language which at the very least belonged to the same over all family (Indo-European), meaning that English was not *too* difficult for people to learn, even if they had no formal schooling.\n\nReally though, the situation for the U.S rapid rise begun in the 1910s with WW1, America was able to lend extremely heavily to Europe during the war and particularly to Britain, which was very lucrative for the states. Whilst the depression in the 1930s hit hard, America was able to do the same again in WW2 and was essentially able to acquire *a lot* of British overseas bases in exchange for money and equipment. This meant that the two Anglo powers essentially traded roles, with Britain becoming less important and America having a huge industrial capacity, great geographic location and population, and now also access to strategic locations all over the world to project power.  Importantly, the dollar became more important than Sterling.\n\nThis coincided again, with innovations in Europe like the television which allowed American culture to dominate a post-war Europe which was was not under communist control, allowing America to shape attitudes and foreign policy. The Marshall plan also allowed America great leverage over Europe and to support remaking these countries as friendly governments which were by and large, mostly dependent on America for protection from the threat of communism.\n\nThe leverage America had over Britain post war effectively ended Imperial power and Americas greater wealth and now ability to project power, allowed them to work in concert with Britain to economically dominate the countries which has been granted independence by Britain (non white colonies) which were economically viable and they were in a position to do so.  For the dominions (white colonies) these largely switched from Britain to America and whilst independent, adopted a similar role to Europe in terms of a quasi-vassal like status.\n\nSimilarly in east Asia, the collapse of the Japanese empire and threat of communism meant that south Korea/Japan and was would eventually become Taiwan all fell under US influence.\n\nThroughout the 1970s America was able to leverage the increasing importance of oil and cement the dollar as the world's leading currency for trade. \n\nWhilst the Soviet union posed a nuclear threat, it never posed a threat to American dominance economically nor did it ever post a direct threat of invasion into America itself.\n\nThe long and short of it is, America was founded in the right place and at the right time, and has not ever really had a major threat that could have stopped it's meteroric rise. The only country that ever really could have posed a threat for the first 2/3 of its history was Britain, however after independence there was never much of an appetite in Britain to try and bring America back into the fold as the British has a lot of economic power in America even after independence.",

It became far more powerful than those countries. This is because of its ability to maintain political stability for most of its history, with the existential exception being the Civil War, while also attracting entrepreneurs to build factories and businesses. \n\nGeography helped. The US has only bordered two countries by land for most of its history, and it was able to stay out of global wars until it industrialized.\n\nAmerica’s emphasis on industrialization was the major factor that most answers missed.",

                    "body": "1. **Free expansion against weak opposition**: Native Americans were inferior in military technology and equipment. But even if they weren't, they were getting wiped out across the continent without white people having to do a thing: Old World disease crushed most Native societies and thinned their numbers so much that colonisers could easily bully them into whatever they wanted. Culturally, most Native Americans also treated warfare differently. War raids were a sacred practice meant to bring honor, and one could win a war raid and maintain their victim's honor by sparing their life. This is also just because Natives had a lower population, they couldn't afford to throw away their numbers like that. Europeans didn't care about death. That's why dying in battle in a blaze of glory is still respected in American culture.\n\n2. **Almost impossible to invade and impossible to garrison**: The American heartland is VERY far from other polities which could pose a genuine threat to it. It is also absolutely enormous, so holding more and more territory for any length of time would be increasingly costly. The fact that American civilians were often armed made any incursions into American territory even more difficult. The only major threats the US has ever faced on its continent are the UK and Mexico. The former lacked the manpower to fully secure the US outside of urban areas in the Revolution and 1812, while Mexico had its own geographic and political struggles that made it very hard for them to mount a unified offense. No one else has ever been a threat because they are either too far away and/or don't have the manpower close enough to actually pose a legit threat.\n\n3. **Geography**: American waters are amazing. The Mississippi is fully navigable, allowing dozens of states to join their economies together. The Appalachians were barely an obstacle for early settlement and the Great Plains were a highway for Manifest Destiny. Most of the entire eastern half of the country is amazing for farming and easy to develop railroads on too. And if that wasn't enough, the US found California, which has basically everything and would be the 4th largest economy in the world if it was independent ahead of Japan.\n\n4. **Resources fit for an empire**: The US has never had one key resource which overpowers its economy, which leads to Dutch disease. Nevertheless, the US found large amounts of coal in West Virginia, oil in Texas and Alaska, iron in Pennsylvania and Minnesota, and almost everything else in the Western states. \n\n5. **The biggest competition takes itself out, part 1**: The British divide up India and bleed its riches back to Europe for centuries. Qing China falls technologically behind, culturally complacent,  economically divided and militarily overextended until it explodes into its warlord era just a few decades before the US's peak. Don't think those two will pose a threat for a little while.\n\n6. **What about Europe?**: Oh, they had two world wars which cost them everything, including their global empires. And guess who built most of the stuff that helped the winning side? The same country that's now rebuilding all of Europe and is now in a Cold War with an institutionally inferior opponent. But the word \"Communism\" sounds scary, so lots of countries will be afraid and look for the USA to help them now. All that diplomacy means a lot of money and weapons being thrown around. American money and weapons.\n\n7. **The biggest competition takes itself out, part 2**: Oh, the Soviets broke up without the US having to do that much about it. All that building up from the past few decades now puts the US so far ahead of everyone else it's unbelievable.\n\n8. **Culture**: This isn't the 8th part of the American story, it's something that's been happening from the beginning. The US being a haven for immigrants is a blessing, and so is its business-friendly culture. Innovators have been coming to America for centuries and are able to use America's wealth and political stability to further themselves, which furthers America. We wouldn't have created the atomic bomb without European scientists who fled across an ocean to save their lives.",

We made quite a lot of money selling weapons to the allies. Once we finally did enter, we essentially had a fresh army going into a war that had been raging for quite some time and we were on the side that won. After the war, production in Europe was extremely low because the infrastructure and workforce was decimated. This drove up the price of American exports and made the economy absolutely explode. Then the population spiked at the same time. Our only real geopolitical foe and this time was Russia and outside of oil, Russia lacked a diverse economy and of course, was a war-torn nation. This gave the US a huge leg up in the second half of the 20 century where an enormous amount of wealth formed.",

Ex. The infamous 280-ton brigantine *Mary Celeste* had a crew of less than a dozen seamen when she set off from New York to Genoa, Italy with a cargo of 1700 barrels of alcohol. In comparison, a sloop-of-war like the Canadian 250-ton *Queen Charlotte* of similar size had a war-time complement of 126 men.",

Most countries just say, \"We're not making dollar/pound/whatever notes anymore\" at the same time they introduce a coin of that value and that's that. As for why, I don't really know. I guess because any little thing that will irritate a part of the public has a tendency to become a culture war issue in US politics. We haven't even changed who is on our money in something like 90 years, and every time an attempt is made by one administration, the next one rolls it back.",

It has always been cheaper to produce notes rather than coins but notes get damaged more easily and need to be replaced more frequently so over time the cost savings of producing notes rather than coins is lost. However, technology in note production has improved over the years and the lifespan of notes has increased substantially. \n\nHere's(and [here](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-300)) the [highlights ](https://www.gao.gov/assets/d19300high.pdf)from a 2019 report the GAO did on the matter. They utlimately found that replacing $1 bills with coins would cost between $611 million - $2.6 billion depending on how aggressively they were replacing them. And it wouldn't really provide much, if any, benefit. It would also cost banks(including the government), armored car companies, etc more to transport them since a coin weighs more than a note.\n\nTL:DR - Would cost too much and provide no benefit.

In the Lost Cause pantheon, he's basically regarded as the South's own Jesus Christ, who could do no wrong.\n\nIn actuality, he wasn't quite as opposed to slavery and was actually quite brutal as a slaveowner himself, whipping his slaves personally at times. During his invasion of Pennsylvania, he allowed his troops to kidnap black people to sell into slavery back in the South.\n\nAs a general, he did do some great feats like the Battle of Chancellorsville, but they were all incredibly costly in terms of manpower, which he knew he had a limited supply of. In addition, he ordered Pickett's Charge, which was nothing short of a foolhardy disaster. He also had no grander strategic vision beyond his own theatre of war in Virginia: he at times refused to send troops West when they were needed dearly there. In short, he was probably above average as a general, but definitely not among the greats.",

His voyages were often framed as a great success and an act of daring exploration that discovered a land already inhabited by indigenous peoples. In reality Columbus's actions were marked by brutality. He enslaved mistreated and killed indigenous people. His reign as governor of Hispaniola was notorious for its harshness.\n\nAfter his return to Spain Columbus was even arrested and returned in chains due to his mismanagement and tyrannical rule. The myth of Columbus as a hero was reinforced over centuries due to a combination of nationalist sentiment religious motivations and a desire to legitimize European colonization of the Americas. Columbus's voyages were positioned as the catalyst for European domination and colonization. This framing served the interests of imperial powers and colonial powers.\n\nIn recent decades Columbus’s legacy has come under intense scrutiny. Movements to recognize the suffering of indigenous peoples and to reassess the impact of colonization have led to a reevaluation of his role in history. Columbus Day has been replaced or challenged by Indigenous Peoples' Day in some parts of the world. Nice",

They were pretty barbaric even by late 18th century standards. Their adoration is largely a product of their religious tolerance, but this was done to maintain themselves on the throne in a Hindu majority Mysore rather than their progressive nature. The wars between Britain and Mysore are portrayed as a national struggle against Colonialism, but the actual goals of the duo was to maintain power and conquest of south india, not Indian independence.\n\nTipu, when he started losing in the 3rd Anglo Mysore war, tried to give it a religious character and dropped the prior policy of good prisoner treatment. He was pretty temperamental at times and could be considered an Indian Pyrrhus.\n\nIf anyone is still interested, there is a free series on YouTube called Sword of Tipu Sultan, which paints a messianic figure of Tipu, to the point of hilarity on a few occasions. I would also recommend reading British accounts and Indian books which were recently published to understand the duo better.",

Surviving the Americans by Robert Hilliard is an eye witness account by a US Army private journalist sent to report on a concert given by survivors for survivors being housed in a monastery near Landsberg,Germany. He became aware that there was little food, clothing or medical supplies available from a survivor-doctor who was charged with providing medical care for recently released survivors. The doctor commented to Hilliard that the Americans weren't much better than the Nazis because they weren't dying as quickly as they had been. Hilliard and a fellow soldier started smuggling supplies into the camp until they were threatened to stand down or face consequences. They decided to compose a letter to relief agencies in the USA to explain what they saw and a copy of the letter landed on Truman's desk. Truman sent an emissary to Eisenhower in Paris and confirmed Hilliard's experiences.  Fast forward a few years and Pres Eisenhower appointed Allen and Foster Dulles to head the newly organized CIA and the State Dept. The Dulles brothers proceed to topple governments, assassinate leaders and foment conflicts worldwide, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia,The Congo, Iran, Central America, Cuba and other places with little or no oversight. A relatively recent book, The Brothers by Kinzer is a well researched account of their activities before and after WW2. Noam Chomsky has written and spoken about this for many decades.",

Hollywood sold us on a whitewashed, romanticized, and sanitized vision of the Wild West. A “Wild West” that never actually existed and was much more boring, but arguably much more brutal and morally grey than what you see in the movies\n\nThere were no duels (if someone didn’t like you, they’d probably just shoot you in the back of the head when you weren’t looking lol. Who would want to risk getting killed in a duel?) There were barely any epic shootouts between evil outlaw gangs and noble lawmen. And other than prostitutes, there were barely any women in the towns.\n\nCowboys were not considered cool or looked up to in any sort of way either. Being a cowboy was a poor man’s job, like a janitor or something. You’d probably be constantly covered in dirt and shit, and have the scraggliest of beards. Oh yeah and since there wasn’t many women many cowboys did a lot of gay activities with each other lmao.\n\nAnd no, not every settler on the frontier spoke with a Southern accent. There were many people from many different places like Europe, Asia, and other parts of the US like the Northeast and Midwest.",

He did approve advisors going in, but it was to be temporary and he was vehemently against sending in combat troops. Just before he died, he had drafted up order 263 to withdraw all American personnel. LBJ reversed it, literally on his first day in office.\n\nThe Bay of Pigs only happened the way it did because the CIA lied to JFK about the capabilities of both the Cuban defenders and the invading force. They expected him to cave and provide aerial support mid-operation when he was adamant that he would not do so. He stuck to his guns and the operation failed. This is probably what ultimately got him killed.",

Mina Miller Edison continued to live in the Fort Myers residence until her death in 1947, when she basically gave the entire Edison estate to the City of Fort Myers - including all of the Edison belongings - for free. The Edisons are also documented as being local philanthropists, including giving their time and money to developing and assisting the segregated Dunbar district, which was home to many poorer African-American residents.",

They also plunged the country into staggering debt with their huge military spending (over 50% of their budget, which is absolutely incredible), and they tried to alleviate this debt by stealing all the money and property from the Jews, using prisoners as free slave labour, and invading/looting other countries.\n\nI know that praising Nazi competence is not technically the same as praising Nazi beliefs, but I feel like it's a sneaky way for Nazi sympathizers to praise the Nazis without admitting that they're praising the Nazis.",

The rude, fierce settler who drives the savage from the land lays all civilized mankind under a debt to him. American and Indian, Boer and Zulu, Cossack and Tartar, New Zealander and Maori,—in each case the victor, horrible though many of his deeds are, has laid deep the foundations for the future greatness of a mighty people. The consequences of struggles for territory between civilized nations seem small by comparison. Looked at from the standpoint of the ages, it is of little moment whether Lorraine is part of Germany or of France, whether the northern Adriatic cities pay homage to Austrian Kaiser or Italian King; but it is of incalculable importance that America, Australia, and Siberia should pass out of the hands of their red, black, and yellow aboriginal owners, and become the heritage of the dominant world races.",

Vain, egoistical, narcissistic are the first words that come to mind for me.\n\nI actually think that Caesar's work isn't overly egotistical. I've only read from *De Bello Gallico* as part of my Latin instruction, but Caesar's efforts to make the work appear as though it were an impartial relaying of events from the field sort of works against your assertion here. If I were an egotistical general, why would I not relay my deeds in the first person, embellishing all the while? If anything, I'd say that Caesar's writing reveals that he was aware of the dubiousness of his campaigns and the ire he was drawing back in Rome. These are not the marks of a vain person, they do show a cunning mind and an excellent command of the Latin language (he even earned praise from Cicero of all people). Caesar was undeniably a ruthlessly ambitious man, eager to claw his way to the top, but vanity would be harder to pin on him from his work alone.\n\n>And if we may judge him by modern standards, he was also very xenophobic. Especially against Gauls.\n\nThe Romans as a whole were rather xenophobic, like many other Mediterranean civilizations at the time. Even their relationship with the Greeks, whom they viewed as at least as civilized as themselves, demonstrates this. Roman literary works are quick to assign many negative traits to the Greeks, such as greed, duplicity, and effeminateness. For what it's worth, the Greeks often held negative views of the Romans too.",

In real life, of course, Jackson was dead and Lieutenant General Richard Ewell had command of the Second Corps. General Lee ordered Ewell to seize the hill “if practicable.” Ewell looked around and decided it wasn’t “practicable.” And so the hills remained in Federal hands and were steadily fortified and reinforced. They formed the “hook” of the famous Federal “fishhook” position at Gettysburg that the Confederates failed to break.",

I guarantee you that if the frontier was never so romanticized by Hollywood, we’d probably see way more Black cowboys in movies that take place in the Old West. \n\nFortunately though, the history of black cowboys has become more well known in recent years thanks to internet discourse/black cowboys on social media",

The reality is that he was the most progressive president to that point in American history, he essentially devised the modern administrative state that every modern country attempting democracy uses as a model, he brokered one of the greatest compromises in banking history with the establishment of the federal reserve system, and he liberated multiple European nations, some of which were afforded their own government and sovereignty for the first time ever. So much of the trajectory of the progress of the 20th century interlinks with foundations that Wilson set in 1910’s. And if you just look at his list of legislative accomplishments, it’s incredible, and would make any self respecting progressive blush if they actually read it. But people on social media don’t know or care about any of that because *checks notes, oh yes because Wilson watched a racist movie",

All while sticking with the Hamiltonian principle of not having the government itself run the bank or banking system. \n\nThis was a major victory in American history, and one of the greatest compromises brokered by any president. The country was desperate to stop boom bust cycles and figured a modernized banking system with reserve banks scattered around the country would help keep the money flow more consistent and fluid. And it’s helped us out over and over again. \n\nThere’s nothing inherently anti-progressive about the federal reserve system. Sure it’s run by bankers, all banks are. But it’s a people first system, aimed at making things better for average people, especially during times of national economic hardship and money runs. Money runs killed regular people, not just banks. The Fed alleviated this. \n\nAdditionally a lot of complaints people have about the Fed are from reforms that came long after Wilson. Wilson simply establishing the Fed should not be seen negatively, especially when it was a progressive move at the time with support from the progressive movement. If it weren’t for the progressive era, we never would have gotten the federal reserve system. So yes, my case stands. Starting the Fed was a progressive move, and even if it wasn’t, that doesn’t change any of the hundreds of major progressive moves Wilson made that weren’t related to the Fed. \n\nPeople are really good at cherry picking a few things to justify their blind hate of Wilson",

There are lots of remnants from the civil war here, but a lot of people don’t know them. Union square in San Francisco is called that because at the start of the civil war massive pro-USA rallies took place there. California excitedly joined the effort for the most part. California also provided more medics and nurses to the US war effort than any state. There were also some small skirmishes around the state between US regulars and secessionist sympathizers. \n\nI think California’s role in the war is not well known, but I think it links to a bigger problem: descendants of confederate soldiers are just more proud on average than descendants of Union soldiers. There are so many groups for confederate descendants. They keep their stories close to the family and pass them down. Meanwhile the US formed the largest army in the world at the time to fight the civil war, and we rarely hear about it from the descendants of those people",

In fact its well known Churchill was popular among women, and it is the fighting men he is unpopular with. Stunning truth is the very soldiers he commands to victory are the people who not only vote him out, but overturn the woman's vote to such a degree it gives Labour the biggest landslide in its history.\n\nYou will find plenty of hints of this in media on Churchill.

The majority of the year’s yield was the winter aman crop, which supplied 74% of the food for the year. The crop of 1940 was exceptionally poor and so stores were used in 1941. The crop of 1941 was adequate, but not enough to replenish the stores. The fall of Burma in 1942 led to the loss of its exports to Bengal, with initial result that exports from Bengal increased, as they sought to provide assistance to other areas. Imports to Bengal were too low to meet their needs, even before the cyclone hit in October which caused severe damage to the aman crop of 1942.\n\nBy 1943, food administration was entirely in the hands of Indians.\n\nThe Indian central government had delegated powers to the provinces to control exports and, in their anxiety to conserve their own resources, the provinces refused to export surplus food to Bengal. The solution to this short-sighted selfishness would have been to centralise control, and to force those provinces with a surplus to export rice to Bengal.\n\nInstead, in March 1943, the Bengal government demanded that all trade barriers be removed, and this was instituted from May. This was an abject failure, the firm of Calcutta rice merchants that the Bengal Government tasked with buying rice for the Government made a good profit, but the stock it purchased was insufficient, and prices remained extremely high in Bengal. It was only in June 1943 that this policy was reversed, and at the end of August that alternative measures started to be taken.",

While you could argue that they should have known X-rays cause radiation burns, and that may have been known from the burns showing up after the exposure, actually understanding that the burns caused the ulcers, edema and neuropathy is a very different endeavor. And Edison did specifically only allow Dally to work with X-rays and stopped all work in 1902 when it was clear it caused some kind of health problem. \n\nAgain he was an ass and you could rightfully say he was covering his ass by stopping work on x-rays, but the radium girls continued to work for another 20+ years not far away. But I think this is a lot more along the lines of accidentally doing something dangerous and stopping verses seeing the same thing happening to the same group of people and ignoring it. And Edison did stop doing it all together after it clearly caused health problems",

And therein lies the problem. \n\nWhen he crossed the rubicon he had a choice. Either civil war or hand himself over to a faction that had proven they were entirely willing to kill him.

There’s a chance for meaningful reforms that would have saved the republic, there’s a chance that minor things would have happened and the republic would continue declining, or he could have become the first emperor. We’ll never know. Although the first option does seem unlikely. \n\nAugustus should however not be used as evidence either way. He may have been Caesar’s heir.

One could even argue that saying he’s a dictator for life isn’t that strange because it says *how long* he can be dictator for. \n\nAdditionally, he publicly refused the offer of a crown thrice, symbolically showing that he was not implementing a hereditary monarchy through his imperium. He was only dictator for five years, was elected to 10 years of further dictatorship before his death, and at some point historians think he was given the dictator for life handle very shortly before his death but it is not known precisely when. IMO I don’t think this part was more than rumor or a real thing that has been misunderstood in the two thousand years since. It was likely an honorific among others that were being granted to Caesar as he was being raised to a religiously mythical status which is a little complicated because in Rome such semi-deification of statesmen and leaders was somewhat common as their faith was a lot less dogmatic than we consider religion to be now. It basically meant that he’d have imperium even if he wasn’t wielding it, which if he did intend to democratize the republic meant that he could reassert his dictatorship at need to stabilize it when it got shaky. \n\nI consider it somewhat equivalent to the unofficial power George Washington held even out of office in the early United States. If he had a less soft hand, he would be considered as a dictator because he could muster the loyalty of the army and was held in such high regard generally that opposing him was impossible, but as it was he used the mandate he had to inspire the nation towards republicanism and had such a power that presidents until *FDR* never ran for more terms than George Washington did despite it being legal– and FDR’s blasphemy was so great in running for and winning *four* terms that Congress cemented the two term tradition of Washington into law through an amendment immediately upon FDR’s death. In the military, we retroactively ensure no serviceman can ever outrank George Washington, to the point we’ve posthumously promoted him to General of the Armies, with only two other servicemen (Pershing and Grant) being conferred the rank.",

I mean, yeah, they both essentially became military dictators, but Augustus' political innovation was that he 'restored' the Republic and put a lot of effort into making it seem like he definitely wasn't a dictator. Instead of being declared dictator for life, Augustus simply had a few additional 'honors' personally granted to him by the Senate - of course, these additional honors came with responsibilities and a few extra powers. These powers allowed him to effectively wield power behind the scenes while allowing him to present himself as 'just another Senator that has been honored by his peers.' Augustus himself generally used the title 'Princeps' (First Citizen), while his successors would end up focusing more on the military aspects of the role, which gave the title 'Imperator' (Commander). This is where we get the word Emperor from. \n\nSo there wasn't a Star Wars moment of \"I declare EMPIRE,\" but instead the collection of responsibilities that Augustus was personally assigned eventually became a position known as Emperor.",

It’s possible it goes back to earlier, but interestingly Northern California and Southern California were pretty divided on the war. While NorCal overwhelmingly supported the US, a lot of people in SoCal were southerners and had heavy confederate sympathies. There was a ton of tension. \n\nNot surprising at all that confederate privateers were trying to steal US gold. California’s gold was one of the largest suppliers of funding for the Union cause. Gold was leaving California by ship to get across the country, so no surprise there were confederate sympathizers ready to steal it as soon as it hit the ocean.\n\nIt’s super interesting to consider the impacts and events of the war outside of the main theaters of the war. The war was absolutely changing daily life in California, and despite being across the continent from the real action of the war, Californians were pretty passionate about which side they supported",

The Alabama State capitol, one of the chambers of the legislature still had a Confederate flag in it. Tours of the capital were conducted by very old ladies who were members of daughters of the Confederacy, most of these women had grandfathers who fought in the war. We were told by one of these women on our tour of the capitol that the reason the Confederate flag still stood in the Alabama legislature was because Alabama had never actually formally surrendered because Robert Lee did not have the power to surrender anything other than his army. He certainly could not surrender the state of Alabama. \n\nOne of my classmates, a real historian, try to argue this with her until our teachers shut him down. He was still fuming about it for days.",

It goes into more detail and informs my opinion of the situation. Edison was working in New Jersey and I would think he would have gotten word of injuries from it. From the book:\n\nMiracles in our time always seem to combine blessing with menace. Rontgen had used a zinc box and lead plate to focus his beams, to protect the photographic plates in his lab from being accidentally exposed. This procedure co-incidentally protected Rontgen himself. Others were not so fortunate. In **1896** Columbia's H. D. Hawks demonstrated Rontgen rays at Bloomingdales department store in New York City. He noticed a dryness on his skin, which became something of a sunburn, and then scales appeared. Over the following months, his fingernails stopped growing, the hair on the side of his head fell out, and he had trouble seeing. His eyelashes and eyebrows fell out, and the skin became very painful.\n\nThe February **1896** *Electrical World* announced that Thomas Edison suffered \"Rontgenmania.\" Following the public euphoria, the great inventor ordered his employees to investigate any and all x-ray possibilities for seventy hours non-stop, keeping them awake and working by hiring a man to aggressively play the accordion. By May, the New Jersey lab offered a fluoroscope demonstration at New York's Electrical Exhibit so that the public could appraise its own bones. The exhibit was run by the glassblower Clarence Madison Dally, who then spent a number of years helping to develop and Edison X-ray lightbulb. After years of work, Dally's hair fell out and his skin started erupting in lesions that wouldn't heal. **Edison cancelled the bulb but Dally continued working with Rontgen rays**. Burns on his hands became cancerous; both of his arms were amputated to save his life. It did not work and he died in 1904 at the age of thirty nine, becoming the first human known to be killed by X-rays. His death stopped Edison's Rontgenmania for good; the wizard of Menlo Park never worked with radiation again.\n\nThere is another book that talks about someone inspecting light bulbs with x-rays and losing an eye and then using his other eye. I am not sure where that is from.\n\n  \nEdit: the thing that bothers me the most is that Edison allowed his employee to continue working with X-rays even after the effects were manifesting themselves. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence\\_Madison\\_Dally#Radiation\\_effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Madison_Dally#Radiation_effects)",

Imagine being someone (not Edison) at that time and looking at this. Radiation is something that was only recently discovered and the health effects are known for maybe 4 years at most based on one specific person nearby. Maybe you have some connections to Europe or modern scientific discovery so that number may increase a bit more but they are mostly mild (losing hair/nails and dry skin are the mild effects). Maybe you can see the effects on some people with burns who worked on it but not everyone gets these effects. Maybe you can start to see the Radium girls too but I am not certain the timeline for that. Some do get the effects but others do not (this is all based on exposure doses and luck). While these are minor this is also the time that people are dealing with a lot more health problems that are more prevalent and more well known. \n\nNow imagine a person who you worked with for approximately 6 years go from a normal person to a double amputee (at least one). You see that he is the only one in the lab working on X-rays and the only one who developed these effects while everyone else has had the more mild symptoms, if any. While before you might brush it off as a mildly dangerous thing (if that), you now see it is a very dangerous thing. It doesnt make the action right in hindsight, but it is an unfortunate consequence of working with new technologies. And after seeing the danger you make changes, in this case banning all work on x-rays in this lab.\n\n(And before you mention cancer rates, this was the early 1900s, tobacco and industrial smoke was everywhere so cancer was a lot higher overall and would be difficult to tag to radiation directly. This needed the radium girls as the effects needed cohort level study)\n\nFor a more modern example, look at the use of thalidamide in managing morning sickness in pregnancy. The FDA made a not well informed decision and this resulted in fetal malformation/death. However as a result of this, the FDA changed the guidance of testing medications during pregnancy to prevent another thalidamide.",

The other thing is I am a great admirer of George Westinghouse and was never a fan of Edison. I highly recommend the book [Empires of Light](https://a.co/d/buEsFqH) which is about early electrification efforts. I also read a biography of Westinghouse which led me to admire him.

Thats what the data says and that tells a very different story to the one that is told in popular history.\n\nYou can certainly reassess evidence, and look for new evidence.\n\nBut you are presenting evidence of extreme popularity, as being the opposite, evidence of unpopularity. And yet you claim without anything to counter that, that to take the evidence on face value, is being biased.",

Colonial Japanese industrialization certainly benefited Korea in the post-war world after 1945, but Japan didn't commit a 'necessary evil' on Korea for Koreas own good. They committed to an economic exercise for their own benefit with every intention of continuing to benefit from it for generations to come. Koreans benefiting from it was an opportunistic rhetorical device that ended up being true by happenstance more than design.\n\nIf I destroy your crappy beater car and you use the insurance money to replace it with a nice new, and affordable, Toyota Camry, it would be really fucking weird for me to describe my black out drunk driving that almost killed you as a 'necessary evil.'\n\nSo I don't really like the word 'necessary' here. 'Necessary' carries too much baggage except when carefully couched.\n\nWas it necessary for the American Civil War to happen to end slavery? I mean, the Confederates certainly thought it was necessary to preserve slavery, and then the war became a war to end slavery, but nothing about that conflict was 'necessary.' Necessary is a post-hoc value judgement that complicates the past more than illuminates it.",

While civilian casualties were enormous it serves to bring home the point that there was no stab in the back, the Nazis were just lesser than the allies.

The same of course goes for Japan. But that ended with the Nukes already mentioned. \n\nAs an another option, far less ethically dubious it’s the refusal of the British to take back the Channel Islands. Occupied by the Germans in 1940, these essentially British isles were occupied for five years. Not liberated until Germany surrendered in May 1945. Despite the fact that overlord past right by. The civilians suffered tremendously because of that. A German detachment occupied the island while resources and supplies dwindled. \n\nBut the Channel Islands also used a full 10% of all concrete spent on the entire Atlantic wall from Norway to the south of France. 10% was spent on these tiny, strategically and tactically useless islands. The defences  of the island made Normandy look positively quaint. Attacking it would have been a tremendous waste of time and lives, and so Churchill just let them be occupied.",

However, only four years of Nazi occupation led to the death of 10 million civilians, and 10 million soldiers.

Sherman is a dirty word.\n\nSherman, before just about anyone else, predicted where modern war was going. He knew the only way to get the South to quit without needless death tens of thousands more men on both sides was to completely cripple the South's economy and transport network, the key to which was Georgia.\n\nNow Sherman did his best to limit the damage done to private citizens who were not directly involved with the Southern economy. His general orders guided his troops to leave small farms, private property, and the goods of simple folk alone while encouraging the freeing of enslaved people, the requisitioning of goods from plantations, and destruction of state enterprises such as the railroads.\n\nThe result of Sherman's March was that Lee was cut off from resupply and reinforcement, the Southern economy was completely crippled, and desertion from the CSA spiked as men left to defend their homes from Union \"marauders\". It took decades for Georgia and South Carolina to recover from the destruction wrought by the March, but without it the cost to the Union would have been much higher.",

Europe is massive, every region was a whole different world, and certainly many zones benefited from well, overthrowing serfdom in some zones and setting the bases for mercantilism. And again, I said for a few decades conditions improved for the general population, later on it became a different story. At first it is evident on many sources I have read that the wages were increased exponentially so that the people would be persuaded to work. What you describe is a consequence of that consequence, which is a different thing. Europe was greatly overpopulated and serfs had almost zero value before the plague crippled their numbers greatly. The beginning of the end of serfdom made possible, however unlikely and difficult, for an upward movility to exist.\n\nOn top of that, if anything the fact that peasants managed to organize themselves well enough to revolt, wouldnt be a good thing? Those peoples were organized and had enough opportunities to be able to unify and protest. That's something that was almost impossible to happen (in such scale) on early medieval Europe. I seriously doubt during, say, X century, they didn't have any reason to revolt on a regular basis.\n\n[https://humanities.wustl.edu/features/christine-johnson-how-black-death-made-life-better](https://humanities.wustl.edu/features/christine-johnson-how-black-death-made-life-better) This article I found discussed both our points. Yes, after a few decades of improved material conditions the pay limits were imposed, but also, the workers revolted and concessions were made on many occasions. It created a dynamic class struggle and until later times negotiation was an option. Once more, I talk about XIV century; I concede in later centuries peasants and the like saw a stark decrease of living standarts.\n\nIt also set the economy towards what it is today, and under other conditions it is very unlikely that would have been the case. Yes, the privileged benefited from all this, but let's be real, they benefit on every turning point of history, almost always and without doubt.\n\nI concede that after the first decades there was a new regression, but the plague long, long term consequences were giving population the tools to their living standart improvement. \n\nAnd lastly, I'm not sure if puritanism was DIRECTLY correlated with the plague, if anything, the counter-reformation movement pushed by catholics and the ideological (and literal) wars against protestantism were a more decisive factor.",

Take those away, and the US might simply demilitarize to save money until Germany and Austria came under threat, putting everything basically where it was in the Cold War anyway. \n\nRussia would be weaker, of course, but there also might not have been a NATO without an enemy powerful enough to warrant a multinational coalition, so territorial ambition would also be harder to curb.",

These teens were basically born in the late 1930s or during WW2. They were too young for combat in either WW2 and the Korean War.\n\nThis teen market are largely seen through magazines, such as *Seventeen, Dig, Teen, Teen World, 16 Magazine, Modern Teen, Teen Times, Confidential Teen Romances,* and some cheesy low budget films like *I Was a Teenage Werewolf* (1957) and *I Was a Teenage Frankenstein* (1957)\n\nDwight MacDonald observes in *The New Yorker* in 1958 with his [article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1958/11/29/inventing-the-american-teenager) that this new market is incredibly strong, that not that long ago it didn't really exist the way we know it.\n\nMany books for parents emerged such as *Facts of Life and Love for Teen-Agers, Milestones for Modern Teens, Understanding Teenagers, Do You Know Your Daughter?, How to Live with Your Teenager.*\n\nBut why the United States of America?\n\nWhy didn't Britain or France or Italy during the 1950s have this explosion of teenage market?\n\nSome papers point out that the explosion of the teen market in the US largely has to do with *teen isolation*. This was now a generation that had allowances, did not have to work in factories, had their own bedrooms, mixed with the opposite sex in school, purchased their own vynils, went on dates at the drive-in cinema, etc....\n\nIn other words, this youth was more segregated from adults and spent more time with each other\n\nWas it really that difficult for Canada, Australia and the European countries to develop something akin to this?\n\nHow come this phenomenon is so particular to Americans? Could it largely be the technology and teen isolation?",

Teens there weren’t given regular allowances, so they had far less agency. What I’m stating is that perhaps the ingredients necessary to make a teen market just weren’t there.",

We could posit this is because land empire can make clear land claims as a basis of the power and legitimacy. Maritime empires hinge heavily on maritime trade. When one collapses, it tends to be the result of/result in significant shifts in trade patterns. \n\nOnce those patterns are gone, what is there to reclaim? The trade that once made up the empire is gone/changed, and any subsequent empire will exist in that changed reality absent geography to give it a sort of shape akin to a past empire.",

This is why \"land empires\" (big nations) can reunite: there is some common ground shared.\n\n>> On the other hand, colony breaking free from \"naval empire\" (colonial empire) means that colony is already strong enough to resist metropolis, which precludes reconquest as colony would only strengthen itself after gaining independence.",

Compare that to rounding up all the village idiots, giving them pointy sticks, and teaching them to march. It can take three to six months. Less, if you don't care how many make it home.\n\nAnother point of interest is that a lot of maritime nations tend to set up their economy via trade, while landlocked countries have to develop their own economies and nations.

                    "body": "So I think your question is not conceptually great, and I take a little issue with the idea that maritime empires are not as sustainable as land powers. But I do get why you might see things that way.\n\nThe short answer to your question is that navies are expensive and fragile, and naval experience is a limited resource. A single battle and you can theoretically lose an entire generation's worth of taxes and experience. It's also just more expensive to administer far flung empires.\n\nBut to tackle your question itself, I think you are forgetting that the Roman empire survived as long as it did in a large part because of its domination of the mediterranean and its ability to supply the frontiers via shipping along the Rhine and Danube. The Byzantines then survived for as long as they did partly out of the strenght of their navy.\n\nBut lets take the examples you listed:\n\nAthens: Probably the best example you gave for a weak thassolocracy, lasted 50 years before falling apart. But it's important to note that this polity was succesful at its purpose (defeating the Persians at sea).\n\nCarthage: Only beaten when Rome took control of the seas, becoming a maritime power in its own right. But regardless Carthage survived something like two centuries of pretty all out war with Rome, so it didn't exactly collapse.\n\nVenice: Lasted 1100 years, dominant mediterranean power for several centuries, literally took Napoleon to finally kill it. Extremely resiliant, constantly under attack, and still lasted for a long damn time.\n\nDutch: Took three major conflicts with England to knock it out, and still maintained colonies until the 20th century. Also worth noting that when the British took the Dutch's possesions when the Netherlands stopped being a maritime power (due to Napoleon) and then actually got most of their empire back after the Napoleonic wars.\n\nPortugese: Literally held onto Macau until 1999, despite being completely conquered at least twice during their imperial period. Did not collapse at all really.\n\nSpanish: Made a bunch of comebacks, and was considered a great power until the US kicked its teeth in. But like Spain lost SO MANY wars in the 18th century, came back, lost their new world possesions during the napoleonic wars, came back, and then finally took a siesta after the Spanish-American war. Also worth noting they did all this while having an economy that was one of the most broken ever.\n\nBritish: Really? The British are anything but unsustainable. The british lost the American colonies, and was thouroughly defeated, only to come back and basically fight for 30 years against (at times) literally all of Europe. Then it went on to become the greates Empire the world has seen, dominated global politics for a century, and it only lost control after feeding two generations into the world wars and burning a nearly incomprehensible amount of capital funding those wars.\n\nFrench: Still have an empire, but were never all that maritime focused anyway.\n\nJapanese: Mostly land based in Manchuria and China, but I get your point. Should be noted that the Japanese defeating the Russians in 1905 was a huge influence in the eventual collapse of the Russian empire, and was done at sea. Like kind of the opposite of your example.\n\nMajapahit: I don't get this one at all. The Majapahit collapsed, but it's lands were rebuilt by a similar power, and modern Indonesia is very similar to the Majapahit territory. So that's kind of a comeback.",

You just choose to ignore this and pass if off as \"does not fit my idea of a collapse\". \n\nContributing? Why don't you back up your own theory for starters? I'm asking you - the one who posits \"the theory\" what is the data behind it? Why must others make your point? Elaborate \"collapse\" from your point of view.\n\nRome collapsed. Why did it not bounce back? \n\nAchaemenid Persia collapsed. Why did it not bounce back?\n\nSassanid Persia collapsed. Why did it not bounce back?\n\nMongol Empire collapsed. Why did it not bounce back?\n\nThe Abbasid caliphate collapsed. Why did it not bounce back? \n\nWe can go on... but as it is your theory, why did these land based empires not bounce back? Are they not more prone to? It's almost as - again - every context is specific? Which brings me back to my initial statement: it feels it is more complex than your theory...",

Greek, as a branch of the Indo-European family, has been spoken for a long time over a vast area and it benefited at several times from extended periods official endorsement. The Romans were fascinated by Greek culture and literature so Greek poetry, myths, and philosophy were preserved and maintained under Roman rule. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the East continued on for another 1000 years and in Constantinople Greek was the language of the Roman People and their government. Greek is the liturgical language of the Orthodox Church and has been for nearly two millennia, so like Latin a form of Greek has been preserved and used over vast stretches of time and distance. To say that modern Greeks speak the same language and share the same unbroken culture as their ancient ancestors ignores about 2000 years of history of invasions, occupations, and migrations of foreign peoples and cultures into the region.",

Imperial and imperialism are different in this case.\n\nYet they don't have any Turkish influence in the language or in the population? Well of course they have.

                    "body": "In the Ottoman Empire subjects were ruled separately according to religion and Eastern Orthodox Christian were all in the Rum Millet (Roman nation), although they later put some nationalities into their own millets. Each millet or religious community had their own legal and educational system, for Orthodox Christians, even non-Greek Slavic Orthodox people, their system was in Greek.  \n\nDue to this policy of separate rule, the Ottomans needed Greek speakers to administer their largely Orthodox Greek subjects and therefore allowed many Byzantine nobles to retain a substantial degree of power among their own people.\nBasically, the Ottomans let Byzantine Christians form a kind of empire within an empire ruled by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople who was officially the ethnarch of the Rumi (Romans). The empire had a huge Greek Orthodox population including in Anatolia and Constantinople itself. \n\nThe Phanariot families became extremely influential in the Ottoman Empire from the late 17th century onwards, forming a hereditary aristocracy at the top of Rum Millet. They lived in Phanar, the Greek quarter of Constantinople where the Patriarch was based. The Phanariots were wealthy merchants claiming descent from Byzantine nobility and controlled the Black Sea wheat trade. They had influence over Rum Millet politics and the Patriarchate, providing many of the Patriachs. They also played an important role as diplomats and interpreters for the Ottoman Sublime Porte. \n\nThe sultans exclusively appointed Phanariots in the powerful role of Grand Dragoman of the Sublime Porte from the position’s creation in 1661 until Greek independence in 1821. This role was officially that of a court interpreter but also involved being a powerful political advisor. Being merchants the Phanariots were multilingual and well-suited for the role. They had to be fluent in the main “three languages” of the empire (Ottoman Turkish, Arabic and Persian) and European languages like French and Italian, and of course Greek.\n\nOther than dragoman, other roles they performed included tax collectors and overseeing various state monopolies. They also ruled over the Danubian principalities (Wallachia and Moldavia) as Ottoman-appointed princes (hospodars). Nicholas Mavrocordatos was a Grand Dragoman and the first Greek Danubian prince, appointed to rule both Wallachia and Moldavia starting in the 1710s until his death in 1739 (in four alternating reigns, as the practice was to switch them between principalities). Mavrocordatos hellenized what is now modern day Romania, introducing Greek language, culture, customs and clothing to the region. He set up a lavish court based on the Byzantine model, keeping the memory of the empire alive, and built the Greek Orthodox Stavropoleos Monastery, home to the largest Byzantine music library. His family ruled over the kingdom many time and the position of prince was exchanged among a small handful of Phanariot families. Among them were local Romanian boyars who intermarried with the Phanariots and adopted Greek language and culture. \n\nAs you can see, Greek culture and language remained strong for a long time due to Phanariot patronage from Constantinople Greeks. They often called themselves “Romaioi” (Romans) but they had a strong sense of distinctive Greek identity. And then actually in Greece you had various local nobles who also formed the local civil administration while Ottoman Muslims acted as governors. And in the mountains you had numerous  brigands (klephts) who were out of the reach of Ottoman soldiers and officials who enforced their own laws. To combat the klephts, the Ottoman employed armatoles who were militiamen mostly recruited from defected klephts. They enjoyed highly autonomous rule of administrative regions known as armatoliki.",

You get all that before WWII ended. There's still 9 more years of Stalin to go! Good news though, if you didn't get Gulag'd things would probably get less shit, because they kind of had to.",

                    "body": "Just to expand upon my previous post, as there seems to be some discussion following my comment -\n\nLife in Stalin's Russia wasn't explicitly \"good\" or \"bad\" for everyone, as we all understand that to be impossible, even in Finland, ranked the happiest country on the planet, has plenty of criticisms lobbed at it by its citizens.\n\nFor most people, life did improve, to differing degrees, but the average trend was one of improving living and working standards. The Soviet people themselves by and large believed in the project of building Communism and to help put this into context, we must understand that global Capitalism had suffered a critical breakdown with the Great Depression affecting much of the planet, weakening many peoples faith in Liberalism. Many Capitalist countries sought to restructure their economy and allow for more State intervention to either protect the general population from the worst aspects of an ailing economy or to hopefully stave off a complete economic breakdown (and possible rebellion and revolution Ala Russia 1917). On top of this Russians were not so quick to forget the invasion of multiple anti-communist powers post Revolution, so plenty Soviet citizens were quite satisfied with the Communist goals of the CPSU and not particularly interested or optimistic about Liberalism.\n\nThe positive aspects of life that Soviet citizens cite in their support of the government include the robust welfare programs, massive expansion of the education system and literacy campaign, rapid restructuring and growth of the medical field, reduction of working hours and increases in pay along with bonuses (due to the Stakhanovite movement and Piece-rate system). Workers could earn surprisingly large bonuses, extra vacation time and rare consumer goods for surpassing their production quotas. There were positive and negatove aspects to the Shock Worker movement. Perhaps one of the biggest cultural shifts from the Tsarist era to the Soviet era was the focus on Women's rights, which won the CPSU major support from women along with condemnation from anti-communist elements. \n\nAs for the negative aspects, housing was in constant short supply and largely inadequate. The country was still extremely backward and the CPSU focused quite famously on Heavy Industry, partly due to the fear of foreign invasion with Hitler being the most likely suspect. Many people were housed in \"temporary\" barracks, which turned out to be longterm housing. Rooms were cramped and overcrowded and the Communal life of barracks housing left almost no privacy to young couples trying to start a family. Those who lived in the cities had much better housing, either living in apartments or former houses of the aristocracy and bourgeoisie. Consumer goods were constantly in severe short supply. Many workers often had more than enough disposable income to purchase goods, with no actual goods to purchase. Unfortunately, alcohol was often very cheap and plentiful, but it wasn't the only form of entertainment/escapism. Criticism against the government was taken deadly seriously, but encouraged at the same time. \n\nThere seemed to be a general consensus for the poorer elements of society to support the Communists while the wealthier segments were more skeptical. A similar trend is seen with class backgrounds for people and families from former positions of power and wealth being significantly more hostile to Communist policies and young people were more sympathetic than older, especially among women.\n\nThurston's work highlights more of the positive aspects of life in the USSR during the Stalin Era that many people may be unfamiliar with while Davies work focuses more so on the Soviet citizens who were much less enthusiastic about the Communist project.\n\nAllen, Kotkin and Fitzpatrick all have works that touch upon this topic as well, but these two provide an interesting dichotomy of positive and negative experiences even though Davies concludes that most Soviet citizens were either ambivalent or supportive of the CPSU.",

Ask almost any person from the occupied countries about their family history, and you'll always get stories about multiple waves of deportations, executions and disappearances. My grandmother was hid in a food barrel as a kid to avoid deportation. Most of the adults were taken. The crime? They had a fairly well off small farm. My other grandmother's mother actually stood in front of a firing squad before she was pardoned. Her crime? God knows. She was the headmistress at a school, and academics were deemed dangerous. Almost all of the men from either side of the family were deported, but there were also women and children among them. Many did not return. \n\nSo, no, it was not propaganda. I have listened to those stories told with stone faces and hollowed voices. This is a generational trauma that survives to this day. \n\nOh, and the random disappearances were totally a thing.",

Let's talk about something you'd expect the \"Worker's Paradise\" to be good at, worker rights and protections.\n\nStarting in 1929 the USSR moved to a 8 hour a day, 7 day a week workweek, the \"continuous working week\" as Stalin called it.  This law also began the long running trend of criminalizing joblessness, so for workers in the Soviet Union starting in 1929 and lasting until 1941 you were required to work every single day of your life, for the majority of the day, for meager wages and little control over where you worked or what kind of work you did.\n\nHowever, in June of 1940, the situation would get considerably worse.  The new labor law decreed by Stalin mandated heavy restrictions on labor practices, it now became a crime to miss work without prior permission, and to be late more than 20 minutes to work was considered missing work.  It also removed the ability for workers to request job transfers, while additionally criminalizing refusing job transfer requests.  Any infraction of these new crimes carried a mandatory 2-4 month jail term.  Second time offenders received up to six months of hard labor and a 20% wage cut, while offenders past that received Gulag sentences.  Over 18 million Soviets were convicted under this law according to Soviet records, millions of whom were shipped east to Siberia to serve difficult prison sentences in the Gulag just for being late to work for over 20 minutes a handful of times.\n\nThis law would remain on the books until 1956, virtually enshrining slavery in the Soviet system for 16 years.  At least under the Tsar you had some control over what kind of work you did and when.",

From June 26th, 1940 to 1956 the Soviet Union had effectively institutionalized slavery of its entire populace.  it's worth noting that during the period this law was enacted, the Soviet Union was not at war, and it would keep the law on the books for 11 years after World War II ended.\n\nMy comment from earlier that is related to this law:\n\nIn June of 1940, the situation would get considerably worse. The new labor law decreed by Stalin mandated heavy restrictions on labor practices, it now became a crime to miss work without prior permission, and to be late more than 20 minutes to work was considered missing work. It also removed the ability for workers to request job transfers, while additionally criminalizing refusing job transfer requests that came from the workers employer or the state. Any infraction of these new crimes carried a mandatory 2-4 month jail term. Second time offenders received up to six months of hard labor and a 20% wage cut, while offenders past that received Gulag sentences. Over 18 million Soviets were convicted under this law according to Soviet records, millions of whom were shipped east to Siberia to serve difficult prison sentences in the Gulag just for being late to work for over 20 minutes a handful of times.\n\nThis law would remain on the books until 1956, virtually enshrining slavery in the Soviet system for 16 years.",

For Slepyan’s book, turn to Page 160 and you’ll see that phenomenon. There are also countless articles you can find on JSTOR describing this little slice of history, however, the burden is not on myself to find the evidence for you. Like I said in the initial post, these cases were not widespread, but they did happen as a direct result of Stalinist policy. \n\nAnd yes, “visiting” major cities was not “restricted”, however, via a 3 day pass that you can also find via a quick search. That is quite literally a restriction of movement.  According to the Helsinki Report of 1975 as well wait times averaged 10 months for permits. Likewise, finding a job in a city such as Moscow would be impossible. These jobs were heavily gate kept by the residents of the cities, a simple phenomena of supply and demand. Your point as to people who were exiled and left also don’t make sense in the context of OPs question. Sweet, you got exiled to a dog shit place, and then left via train to a lesser dog shit place but still dog shit non the less. These policies were eased after Stalins death but were reintroduced in 64.",

But even within the 1939 borders hoped that the Germans would end their collective farm system, and in several instances they did this on their own initiative. The partisans’ enforcement of Stalin’s ‘scorched earth’ instructions, meant to deprive the occupiers of all usable infrastructure, further alienated much of the populace. In these circumstances, not surprisingly,  many peasants cooperated with the new rulers, including providing information about the whereabouts and strength of Partisan forces.”. My initial post did not claim that the Nazi’s categorically improved “lives” as you suggest in such black and white terms. I stated that some USSR citizens had it so bad that they were sympathetic to them. Also according to my professors lecture who I will not Dox on the internet, but is a known soviet scholar, Nazi collaborators absolutely did fair better, it was simply an incentive. Much of these histories live in the grey, and while I can perfectly acknowledge that it seems that you are trying to form a narrative.  Also I said not “widespread” because absolutely zero scholars know how widespread it was or wasn’t. There are known instances of it happening. It was not rare but it was not common. \n\nYou not caring for a source that is internationally recognized is fine, but shows your bias. Maybe watch some Soviet films that slipped through the censors cracks and understand that they share the same realities that the Helsinki report showed (that permits were often wildly unreasonable to obtain). Evidence exists in the multitude of travel restrictions in the forms of internal passports, permits, and declassified reports. Like you pointed out, I would love to see the evidence on how you formed your opinions? Because as you have ridiculed mine, you have provided none.",

Ah, yes, the Spanish Civil War happened in Spain.\n\nThis is exhausting. I think I'm done talking to you. Have a good rest of your day.

Just plain bullshit. Etc. Popular histories about Japan are also plagued by this, and unfortunately the available scholarly history for Japan in English is not very accessible for a normal person.\n\nBelieve me. As a Dynasty Warriors kid, I long for a good meaty book on the Three Kingdom's period that doesn't require me to fish through JSTOR and the like for articles where someone bothers to put in English the host of Chinese-language resources on the subject. Alas, I continue to wait. The best we have is a biography of Cao Cao.\n\nChina on the other hand, has histories published in English.\n\nI suggest the series [History of Imperial China](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN22WR1?binding=paperback&searchxofy=true&ref_=dbs_s_aps_series_rwt_tpbk&qid=1731590809&sr=8-1) which is written to be a good introduction for the layman. It's six volumes but China's history is entirely too long, with far too many records, for 1 good all around book to really exist. The best I think you can find is the Great Course series[ Yao to Mao](https://www.audible.com/pd/From-Yao-to-Mao-5000-Years-of-Chinese-History-Audiobook/B00DB6KIKC?eac_link=1HWO0GImeUgw&ref=web_search_eac_asin_1&eac_selected_type=asin&eac_selected=B00DB6KIKC&qid=IAvObeYZzX&eac_id=146-4990998-1548860_IAvObeYZzX&sr=1-1). But having listened to that series as background noise, I found it extremely unsatisfying. China has so much history that a single source that tries to cover all of it has no time to share much of any flavor with you.",

The Anschluss of 1938 wasn't entirely involuntary (many Austrians had opposed it, but many had also welcomed it), and many top-ranking Nazis had been Austrians. Like Germany, Austria was divided up into occupation zones post-war. So, increasing Austria's size by giving it extra territory while also occupying it at the same time was fairly paradoxical. \n\nMeanwhile, Italy had sort of 'redeemed' itself when it switched sides after deposing Mussolini. It had even gone through something of a civil war with Mussolini's Italian Social Republic. The loss of its colonial empire was deemed as sufficient punishment for Italy.",

Behind it set the sheriff, or in his rare absence an under-sheriff .  He was \rusually flanked by several of the ranking justices of the county, and at the extreme ends at the candidates.  Near at hand\rwere the clerks or ‘writers’ of the candidates, who sometimes reimbursed their clerical assistants handsomely… Before \rthe voting began, the clerk wrote at the top of a sheet of paper the name of this candidate … The paper was ruled and the\rlines numbered so that one could tell at a glance at any moment in the election exactly how many votes each candidate \rhad.  A less common system of recording votes was to write the names of the voters on the left side of the sheet and to\rindicate their preferences by check marks or otherwise in columns prepared on the right side of the sheet, each column \rbeen headed by the name of one of the candidates.  When the sheriff thought that all was in ready, which was likely to be\rmid-morning after most of the voters had had time to assemble, he opened the election by reading the writ which ordered\rit.  In case there were no more candidates than there were places to be filled or in case sentiment was very one sided, the\rlaw allowed the election to be determined ‘by view’.  Whether the decision was reached in such a case by a show of \rhands or by some other method is not revealed in the records. \n\n\r\r\r“When a poll was taken – the election by poll seems to have been more frequent than by view – the voters presented \rthemselves one by one before the table where the election officials sat.  Voters were not registered before elections, and\rthere were no officials to turn back nonqualified men before they reached the polling place.  However, the sheriff could \rrefuse to take the vote of a man who he knew to be disqualified, and each candidate had the right to challenge any voter\rand to require that he swear that he met the legal requirement.  Objections could be entered by the names of doubtful \rvoters to serve as a beginning point for a House of Burgesses investigation in case the election was contested.  The \rmost common objection was ‘no freehold’.  Others were ‘under 21 years old’, ‘not a citizen of …  Virginia or of the United\rStates’ …  As each freeholder came before the sheriff, his name was called out in a loud voice, and the sheriff inquired \rhow he would vote.  The freeholder replied by giving the name of his preference.  The appropriate clerk then wrote down\rthe voter’s name.  The sheriff announced it as enrolled, and often the candidate for whom he had voted arose, bowed,\rand publicly thanked him” (p. 27-29).\n\n\r\rSydnor, Charles S.

People like to collect antiques in part because of an appreciation for the past, even if the raw material value isn't very high, ie, it's not something you could sell for scrap. An ancient stone neolithic tool isn't inherently valuable expect for the fact our society finds it interesting and worth protecting. The same can go for, like, an ancient Roman shoe or wool cloak dredged out of a bog.\n\nWould an ancient Roman have collected material goods from 1,000, 2,000 years ago out of interest in them? Did wealthy families in 900AD keep around old stone carvings or a bone hairpin they understood to be from centuries before? Would they have wanted to know more about those societies/speculated on them? Would someone who stumbled upon Egyptian grave goods in 300AD keep someone just for the sake of keeping it and saying, hey this is an old thing?",

Uppermost nobility (sometimes descended from royalty) explicitly connected to military service. \n\nHRE equivalent of Boyars would be Landeshoheit Princes (sovereignty within their hereditary demesne, and a right to vote in Imperial Diet/Boyar Duma).",

Boyars came up a lot but doesnt really seem to fit the more I look into them as they tend to be considered higher on the noble food chain",

                    "body": "You're thinking in terms of western feudalism, but boyar has no real comparison in the west.\n\nInitially, the title of Prince was the catchall title for the nobility. Any male descendent of Rurik was entitled to it, and it came with numerous rights and privileges, including land and a retinue. This means that as more people claimed descent the ruling Princely families would lose land. Many people with the title of Prince ended up landless or poor due to their inheritance being divided. An aristocrat who was not a descendent of Rurik was a Boyar, they did not suffer this problem, and many Princes would instead choose for their children to be Boyars instead of Princes. Boyars usually had land and wealth equal to the Princes, but without the noble pedigree. Boyars could be either nobles or peasants, self-made or inherited, titled and landless, or landed and titleless. Boyar is not a title that was given or inherited, it's a descriptor for a class of non noble landowners who rivaled the nobility with wealth and influence but specifically weren't the merchant class.\n\nPolitically they ranked as high as western Duke, or even higher. They formed the council that advised the ruler, or made up the upper echelons of the military and government. They worked as aids, and councilors, but they held the right to leave at any time to work for a different Prince and keep their lands. The word itself supposedly comes from an old word meaning 'a title', so Boyar is basically 'a titled person'.\n\nThe boyars themselves were really no different than the princes they supported. In the west the power triangle consisted of the nobles-clergy-merchants, in medieval Russia it was more the Princes-Boyars-The People. Boyars were not nobility, they were wealthy landowners with lots of political influence that dominated the aristocracy.\n\nBy the 15th century the status was a title that was granted to only the senior members of specific families. The Boyars and the class under them could be understood in a way that's similar to the British house of lords, but in a confused mess of social rules.\n\nThe English had a class called a Yeoman, it was a freeman who owned his own land, usually a farm or a forest. Imagine a Yeoman who owned so much land he rivaled the local Duke in wealth and influence, and he could leave England and join Scotland anytime he wanted. That is a Boyar.",

Historians would rightly ridicule such methods if attempted today.\n\nSima Qian was the first great Chinese historian, but his writings covered such a vast range of time that he never really had a chance to give an accurate description of China’s history. His work was/is incredibly important, though, as it really tapped into the practice of venerating the elders in Confucianism, and his work presumably gave the Han a template to work from and build off of.\n\nPrior to Herodotus and Sima Qian, any thing that might be construed as historiography was compromised by myths and the practical themes that their authors were trying to pass on to their audience. It really wouldn’t be until the 19th century that we had true schools of history in which historians focused on obtaining independently corroborated primary sources to confidently confirm if an event had taken place.",

It really starts in the 19th century.  Or the study of history as we know it today.  Germans got a good head start and then the United States became the predominant force for academic history for a number of decades (arguably its still the best country for studying history today).  But some of the earliest traces of the academic tradition in history go back to monasteries of the Dark Ages.  There is a reason why graduate study in humanities is structure to be incredibly isolating (and much of study in other disciplines for that matter).",

For a year, my fixation – sexual and intellectual – with her has been the defining feature of my pedantic and at times unstable personality. \n\nIn 1178, Tamar's father King Giorgi III crushed a rebellion by nobles, blinded his nephew Prince Demna, and named the 18 year old Tamar co-ruler. After Giorgi died in 1184, she became sole ruler. \n\nTamar faced a struggle with the aristocracy, who sought to limit her power, and was forced to marry Yuri of Vladimir-Suzdal, a Kievan Rus' prince, in order to provide an heir. Yuri turned out to be an abusive husband and she divorced him in 1187, subsequently surviving two attempted coups. \n\nIn 1191, Tamar remarried to her childhood friend David Soslan, a son of the king of Alania (present-day Ossetia). They had two children, and David led the Georgian army across campaigns against Muslim states. \n\nIn 1204, shortly before the Fourth Crusade, Tamar and David set up the Empire of Trebizond as a Georgian vassal ruled by Tamar's nephew Alexios Komnenos. She defeated the Sultanate of Rum in a battle shortly before that. \n\nTamar's reign saw an economic and cultural boom, including the writing of Georgia's national epic. She died in 1213, being widely mourned by her subjects and foreigners.",

That in itself isn’t very interesting, but you know what is?\n\nHe was a Spanish spy the entire time. \n\nLiterally. His entire career in the military and US government he was a secret agent for the Spanish Royal Family. His codename was “Agent 13” and the only reason we know all this is because a historian stumbled upon his correspondence with the king in Madrid *two decades* after his death. It’s such an interesting story. The guy was put in charge of finding and arresting Lewis and Clark for God’s sake. He also was involved in the Burr Conspiracy but that’s a whole other can of worms. Basically he’s a super interesting guy who might be one of the best spies to ever infiltrate the US, and it happened right as we got our independence.",

On sea, the pattern continued with notable advances in gunsmithing and cannon design.  The Koreans were saved only by the timely intervention of the Chinese Ming Dynasty. \n\nAll sides suffered heavily.  But most of Korea was depopulated, its lands despoiled, cities burned to the ground, and palaces sacked.  The Japanese initiated horrific war crimes which shocked even the hardened Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch observers in a precursor to their descendants in WW2.  The Chinese were beaten back several times as the Japanese even were within striking distance of Beijing.  They eventually triumphed but the fiscal cost was ruinous and led to their later collapse.  Widespread famine, disease, banditry and other social ills plagued Korea for decades. This led to the fateful decision to withdraw from the wider world.",

Yeah, that's why. \n\nIt once spanned from east/west from Iran to Pakistan and from from the Persian Gulf in the south to Uzbekistan to the north. Before the invasion there were probably upwards of five million people in the empire, highly urbanized and after, less than a million scattered about. \n\nIn 1218 a Mongol caravan arrived in a city called Otrar to pass through along the Silk Road, it was pretty richly laden and represented a significant investment by many Mongolian elite. Otrar was run by a guy named Inalchuq, who was related to the Sultan of the empire Muhammad II. Well, he asked for and got permission to slaughter the entire caravan and confiscate the cargo on the pretext that the caravan contained Mongol spies. Unfortunately for the Kwarazmian Empire, one guy got away to report back to Genghis. Genghis was pissed, but did attempt to negotiate by sending a delegation to the Sultan demanding that Inalchuq be punished for his crimes. The Sultan made one of the greatest of all time bad decisions and had the Mongol ambassador beheaded and forcibly shaved his two companion envoys to humiliate them.. and sent them back to Genghis. Well, Genghis responded by invading with a force of at least 100,000 men and they proceeded to sack and destroy every city and kill every inhabitant of the cities.",

There is record of some of this going on. Prehistoric battles, meaning before written history or places that didn't have it could be worse. Small battles were quite common and sometimes villages could be wiped out or forced to move and disperse amongst other people. The best evidence for that is hunter-gatherer tribes that have existed to modern times, oral histories, bones showing violent death, etc.",

Like a war that hurt all civilians involved pretty badly and pretty equally.\n\nKinda like syria, as in the aftermath more than half the country is in hunger and at least 30% is below the poverty line, whilst the average lifespan has been reduced by 10 years. Since the only direct forces fighting was different parts of syria backed by different parts of the world, and seeing how the damage affected nearly all syrians I think this kinda fits my description more.\n\nKnow any wars more like this where countries, sides or whatever received more equal-ish damage the war which had lasting impacts after the event?",

He had also some strong diplomatic skills that allowed him to keep decent relations with Europe, especially France. Before attacking Libya with the US, France had received Gaddaffi and sold him some Mirage jet fighters.",

The visigoths are a later name given to \"The Goths\", that is a name given to a Roman Army. Some will claim they are a migrating people, but there is no evidence for this. A lot of myths grew out from this Army because they sack Rome, but really they are a Roman Army where the most likely explanation is that they were recruited from many of the Goths settled around the Danube after Andrianople. The visigoths end up in southern France, and this seems to have some influence in the name of the Ostrogoths, who are a later development, where ostro means East (Visi was just another ethnonym for \"The Goths\" that became the visigoths). The Ostrogoths are given Italy to rule, but originally were around the Danube or in the east, hence their name.",

                    "body": "The first laws concerning drunk driving were passed in New York in 1910. As for your question in the early days there really was no reliable method to measure B.A.C (blood alcohol content) until 1938 when the first “drunkometer was invented and later used by the Indianapolis police department and many others. Which was a balloon someone would blow into the captured air would then be mixed with a chemical and it would change color when alcohol was detected. \nThere was a suggested .15% legal limit.\n\nIn 1953 the first breathalyzer test would be invented however it wouldn’t see wide spread use till the late 1970s \n\nNow to address punishment. Throughout the Decades the penalty has usually been a hefty fine and a jail time. However the laws were written in ways that had no defined legal limit. It wouldn’t be until the 1960s where a clearly defined legal limits were established depending on the state it would be from .10%-.12%. In  1972 laws regarding drunk driving were changed so that anyone with a BAC of the legal limit would be considered intoxicated. \n\nI the 2000s the legal limit was lowered to the .08% for most states .05% if you’re in Utah 0.4% for comercial drivers and so on.",

Then there was this big Pope again to push fueled by the oil companies who were paying the media and the politicians to create a panic about car safety and automobile wrecks and so forth and so that way they could get laws passed to increase the safety equipment and capability of cars which would increase the weight of cars which would increase the amount of gas they spent per mile. No one understands this now but I was there I lived it.. forgive my speech to text software I'm not going to edit it you can just figure it out",

An elderly couple (a woman age 68 and a man 73) are hit and killed instantly by a hit and run driver.  When they arrive at the scene, they interview several witnesses to the accident. While none agree to the actual make and model of the car, all agree that it was a dark blue sedan. Later that day, Friday decides to give all information about the accident to the newspapers, radio and television; hoping this will assist them in tracking down the suspect.  Several days pass, and the detectives receive a call from a woman who lived directly across the street from where the crash occurred. When they arrive at the home to interview her, she tells them where to find (what she believes to be) the hit and run vehicle. When Friday and Gannon examine the car, they find it is not a blue sedan.  The next day, the two finally receive a break. The owner of an auto body shop informs them he had replaced a windshield in a dark blue 1964 Lincoln sedan the previous evening. They learn from the gentleman that the car is registered to a Clayton R. Fillmore. The police take the shattered windshield to use as evidence.  The detectives decide to pay a call on the Fillmore home where they find Mrs. Fillmore, appearing a little upset. She informs them that her husband was at work; she and he had been experiencing marital problems, and she was on her way to speak to her attorney about a divorce.  Next, Joe and Bill visit Fillmore's workplace where, they coincidentally find Mr. Fillmore speaking with his attorney. Clayton Fillmore is placed under arrest for two counts of felony manslaughter and one count of leaving the scene of an accident. His automobile is also taken as evidence. Showing little remorse, Fillmore is released on bail. When the court date arrives, Fillmore is fined $250 and placed on probation. Friday and Gannon leave the court room a little frustrated.  About six months pass, and Joe and Bill are informed of another fatal accident. This time, two teenage girls are killed. When they arrive at the scene, they learn the the driver of the impact vehicle was Clayton R. Fillmore.  The detectives rush to the hospital and speak to the doctor there. He informs them that Mr. Fillmore was under heavy sedation and could not be talked to. Mrs. Fillmore was in slightly better condition; she was suffering from contusions and traumatic shock but could be seen briefly. Mrs. Fillmore, seeming very distraught, informs them that she dropped the divorce hoping her husband would straighten out. She also tells them that her husband had two drinks before he left his office and would be losing both his legs as a result of the accident!! She tearfully tells Friday: \"he was in a hurry Sergeant.\" to which Friday sadly replies: \"he won't be anymore.\"  In the end, Clayton R. Fillmore is charged with two (more) counts of felony manslaughter and is sentenced to five to ten years in prison. Because of his permanent disability as a result of the accident, however, sentence was suspended. He was also forbidden to ever drive a motor vehicle again as long as he lived; despite the fact that artificial limbs would have enabled him to do so.”",

Winning skirmishes and battled with varying methods. His ability to bring together the various groups of Hussites during the Siege of Prague also shows a different but no less important side of him.",

However, he had done some political fuck-ups like sack and destruction of [Havlickuv] Brod which happened under his command and he was unable to control his own troops. He regretted this incident. Eventually his death prevented to do another mistake that may cause a defeat. The Hussite war eventually continued under brilliant commander Procopius who defeated other several crusades and carry the war into neighbouring countries. In later years, enemies learned from their mistakes and exploited Hussite military weaknesses. They have lost some battles like in Illava in 1431.",

                    "body": "1. Subjective, the first part of their stay, the Umayyad Caliphate was a very prosperous era. The peninsula received many new crop types, advanced maths (coincidentally, I mentioned on my last article how our modern number system was imported from India, modified and eventually transfered to Europe thanks to arabs, and the first evidence of it being known in Europe appears right in Spain, albeit in the christian zone, but nonetheless, still imported by arab groups, [you can read it here if you want to](https://crodur.com/2024/11/12/civilizations-that-counted-up-to-a-million/)), vast libraries that numbered in the hundreds of thousands of books, new artistic styles that meshed with the local culture... also they allowed christians and jews to stay by paying a tax, since they considered them ''people of the book''. \n\nHowever, by 1031 the caliphate fell into anarchy, and great civil wars engulfed the peninsula. They ended divided as a bunch of independent kingdoms, which were at constant odds, by this point, I'd say the living expectancy dropped a lot, instability and austerity increased as the territories had a lot more difficult to sustain themselves since they also had to fend off their neighbours. They eventually let the almoravids, and then the almohads enter from northern africa. Those two were fierce but fanatical empires and caused even more chaos amongst the natives (both of iberian and arab descent). Eventually, the christians took back most of the territories, by 1300s only a small place in the south stayed muslim, the nasrid dinasty. That one was also vulnerable and at mercy from christians, but was stated to be very diverse in activity and somewhat prosperous for a few decades.\n\nSo I'd say the balance is positive. Before the fall of the Umayyads the peninsula was a very important cultural enclave, home of philosophers, saw a lot of scientifical advancement before the rest of Europe did, and the merge of the cultures was unique amongst the west, save for maybe balcanic countries. After the ''bad centuries'', most of those implementations survived with the christians who profited from them. I'd say they overall left the place better than how they found it.\n\n2. Most of the converted ones still practiced their faith in secret. It was pretty much an open secret in their comunities. Their numbers were big and iirc the king... philip iii, was him? feared a revolt amongst them. Most concentrated in south-eastern peninsula and outnumbered even the army, at that point overstreched. Probably a fear of them causing a mass revolt at some point, while the elite troops were on another part of Europe. That could have spearheaded a domino effect of further revolts and that's a recipe for disaster in an Empire that had so many open fronts already. A mixture of racism, but also paranoia and need for stability at any cost. And the cost was indeed great, because suddently removing such a great % of the population, most of them impoverished agrarian workers, did a number to the local economy and created a workforce shortage for a while.\n\n3. The previous reason applies, the portuguese were under very different circumstances and had not the same reasons and necessities than Spain.",

That is how it’s meant to be understood.\n\nAnd then from there you’re talking about a years long dive into Supreme Court and other federal cases, because the text of the constitution isn’t much without the context of the cases that tell you what it means.  \n\nIt’s complex.

In normal kingdoms with normal rulers, non-Muslims were normally just given an extra tax and left alone (more common in the early days of Islam). In theocratic kingdoms with very religious rulers (more common in the later days of Islam and now), non-Muslim women were typically enslaved and non-Muslim men were normally killed during the enslavement process when the castration goes wrong. I think it's something like 70% of the enslaved men died during this process, but it's hard to get exact numbers when the people involved are just considered chattel. Generally speaking, there weren't very many non-Muslims living in Muslim majority areas, but you'd apparently often see slaves they took from Europe, the Americas, and Asia.\n\nBasically, it's pretty similar to what you'd get living in a primarily Shinto, Hindu, Buddhist, or Christian area back in those days if you were part of a different religion.",

The structure of old armies could be quite variable and how they were funded could be chaotic. \n\nThe latter question is hard to give 1 answer on because this is a long period of time concerning a huge swathe of groups and peoples across vast distances. You could if you wanted to look up some battles though, as these groups encountered and clashed with one another;\n\nThe Crusades fought between Western Europeans and the Islamic world.\n\nThe Battle of Talas fought between the Abbasids and Tang China (fought in what is now Khazakstan along the Talas river).\n\nThe Battle of Ain Jalut fought by the Mamluks and the Mongols and one of the watershed battles of history as it deflected Mongol advances into the Near East in addition to the later Battle of Marj al-Saffar.

Hulagu Khan had already pulled out most of the Ilkhanate Mongol forces out of the Middle East area due to multiple factors such as potential bad weather and preparation for elections & civil war because Great Khan Mongke died at the siege of Diayou Fortress during the war against the Song Dynasty in the year before. \n\nHulagu only left a small 10-20k garrison army behind, and it was this small army that was defeated at Ain Jalut. \n\nI've read the Mamluks recieved support from the Golden Horde at Ain Jalut and the Golden Horde played a major role later to save the Mamluks from further attacks. The Ilkhanate Mongols was planning to avenge Ain Jalut and attack the Mamluks with a bigger army when Hulgau returned with his main forces, but was prevented from doing so when the Golden Horde Mongols declared open war against the Ilkhanate during the massive Mongol Civil Wars.",

            "selftext": "I am exploring my family history. And it was always said that my Great-Grandma’s dad was born out of wedlock and “farmed out” to work on a farm when he was 6 years old. As an adult, he moved to USA and that is where we have been ever since. \n\nBut, that was always the term: “farmed out.” No explanation of what this means. We always kind of assumed that his mom didn’t want him and mailed him to strangers or something. (Especially since we are pretty sure the “out of wedlock” was of the traumatic kind)\n\nBut, te other day, I was watching a documentary about the workhouses and poor houses in England. And for the first time I heard that term again: farmed out. Only this time the term was used to describe how poor, unwed and/or widowed mothers would go to the poorhouse and sometimes their kids would be forcibly taken from them and farmed out to another family to work, never to be seen from again. \n\nWould this kind of thing have happened in Germany? Is it more likely that my Great-great grandfather was taken from a mom who loved him? It doesn’t change anything…but it does. ",

Both sides understood this and their armistice which saw little territorial changes but granted Italy favorable port accesses, forced France to demilitarize several areas, and gave Italy a very favorable demilitarized and occupation zone that could of hypothetically later allowed Italy to invade and take southern France (I'm not sure if this was ever discussed overtly).",

Once France fell, it was essential for Germany to get Britain out of the war, either by a successful invasion, or by crippling their ability to make war economically. The first of these required they hold direct control of northern France so as to launch an invasion from there, and the second of these included the essential step of getting Britain out of Suez, Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean. The first of these failed with the Battle of Britain, and the second of these failed when Malta survived its siege and Rommel was turned back at El Alamein. After Alamein, the western and North African theatres were basically a question of attempting to hold the positions they had while the main effort focused on the eastern front. This is why Alamein was so signficant, and why Churchill described it as \"This is not the end. This is not even the beginning of the end. But it is perhaps the end of the beginning\", and in retrospect he said, \"It Amy almost be said, 'before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat'\".\n\nWithout dealing with the Britain situation, messing around with France would just have been an unhelpful drain on resources. Because Britain was never dealt with, we can only speculate what plans might have been for the long term future of France and its North African possessions.",

This cost them ships at sea and made the land forces sluggish to nearly immobile. \n\nOf course a problem was that the local French were in part still following orders from Vichy. Vichy didn't really like the Germans but if they ordered a surrender in North Africa, the Germans would move in and take over, and maybe kill them. At the same time, the local leaders in NA would not surrender on their own, or they would, then orders came not to so they didn't, round and round. Very crazy, in addition to crazy people. If they had surrendered, there wasn't anything Vichy or the Germans could do to them, but their political ambitions might be in the toilet...",

The terms of the Second Armistice at Compiègne included the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine and the German occupation of large swathes of France - but since France’s navy was still far larger than Germany’s and France’s overseas holdings were far beyond German control, the Vichy French government was able to keep a free zone in southern France and overseas which would remain neutral for the rest of the war. \n\nWhile the Vichy government collaborated with Germany, it was officially neutral and didn’t actively attack the British. Later on, the British, Americans and Japanese occupied many Vichy overseas colonies and the British and Americans are able o get Vichy leaders like Admiral Darlan to defect to the allied side - which resulted in Germany occupying Vichy France. \n\nVichy France was unwilling to hand over land they didn’t need to hand over, and they certainly weren’t willing to hand over land as significant as Corsica to Italy. If the Germans insisted on France giving Corsica to Italy, they ran the risk of the Vichy government not signing the armistice and the French navy backing the British - which would make war at sea impossible for Germany.",

Negotiations always take place between national governments, and this makes the whole issue extremely complicated.\n\nMany *belongings* are kept in private museums and collections, so the German state cannot force the \"legal\" owner to return them; many museums have very old charters stating that their mission is \"to care for and expand the collection\", which legally speaking places the museum's management in a difficult position, and despite many curatorial teams agreeing with the repatriation demands, the \"friends of the museum\" associations are usually the largest obstacle.\n\nOn the other side of the negotiation, the people asking for the repatriation might be a local community, and in most countries their interests, those of regional politicians, and of the national government diverge. Moreover, many African countries are discovering that this is a great opportunity for \"blackmailing\" wealthier governments, which I sort of understand.\n\nIn the end, and despite being completely separate issues, foreign aid and repatriation of looted colonial goods too often go hand in hand. African national politicians will slow down the process and force \"Western\" governments to negotiate only with them and not with local communities; they claim that they are tired of \"Western\" intereference, which again, I understand.\n\nIn the case of Canada, United States, Australia, New Zeland, and many Pacific Islands, the affected communities constitute a domestic dependant, sub-national entity, or the largest ethnic group in a country (Pacific Islands), which grants them more political weight in these negotiations between national governments. By contrast, negotiations in Africa are more complicated – the Benin Bronzes, taken from ***Africa's largest country***, a federal republic with traditional rulers (the Oba of Benin), is perhaps the most complicated kind of negotiation. The Benin Dialogue Group is notorious for being unefficient.\n\nThe most important document nowadays is the *Rapport sur la restitution du patrimoine culturel africain: Vers une nouvelle éthique relationnelle* (Report on the restitution of African cultural heritage) by Felwine Sarr & Bénédicte Savoy.",

Then during the 80s the US had another boom, Australia's next boom was the 90s.

You'd then be served grapefruit for breakfast which would obviously sting a bit considering your now cut up mouth.\n\n>If people were captured and you hadn't decapitated someone yet you were given a sword and forced to.\n\n>I'm not trying to absolve anyone of their responsibility but the Japanese knew how to physically and mentally abuse their soldiers to turn them into the types of fighters they wanted.\n\nAnd of course any one who knows World War 2 already been exposed to stuff of this nature regarding Imperial Japan such as how fresh recruits were getting beaten in the face with the metal brass of a belt until they fell down unconscious for simply making tiny mistakes while learning how to march in formation and even officers having to commit self suicide by cutting their stomach and exposing their bowels in front of higher ranked leaders to save face because they disobeyed orders and so on.\n\nBut considering how Imperial Japan's military training was so hardcore recruits dying in training was not an uncommon thing and their cultural institution so Spartan that even someone as so high in the ranks like a one star general was expected to participate in fighting and to refuse surrender but fight to the death or commit suicide rather than capture...........\n\nI just watched the first Ip Man trilogy and in the first movie in the occupation of the home town of Bruce Lee's mentor, the Japanese military governors wee making Chinese POWs fight to the death in concentration camps. In addition civilian Wushu masters who were out of jobs were being hired by officers of the Imperial Army to do fight matches in front of resting soldiers which basically was no holds barred anything goes (minus weapons but you can pick up rocks and other improvised things lying around). The results of these fights were brutal injuries like broken ribs that resulted with the loser being unconscious for months in a local hospital with possible permanent injury. A few of these matches resulted in the deaths of the participants later with at least several shown with people killed on the spot from the wounds accumulated shortly after the fight shows ended with a clear winner.\n\nSo I'm wondering since the reason why Imperial Japan's army training was so harsh to the point of being so outright openly abusive with high fatality rates is often ascribed to the motivation that they were trying to install Bullshido and the old Samurai fighting spirit into recruits...........\n\nWhy didn't the WW2 Japanese army have honor duels and gladiatorial style sparring that resulted in the deaths of recruits in training and officers killing each other? Esp since they army tried to imitate other Samurai traditions such as Seppuku suicide, extensive martial arts training (for the standards of contemporary warfare), and deference to the hierarchy?\n\nI mean after all honor duels was a staple of Samurai warfare even as far as into the Sengoku during Oda Nobunaga's transformation of the Samurai from warriors into an actual organized pike-and-shot military culture. Where Samurai in command including generals would be expected to draw swords and slash at each other if they were challenged just before a battle and even during later the peaceful Tokugawa Shogunate people of Bushi background were given the legal right to engage in death duels to avenge an insult.\n\nThat even among the Ashigaru and other non-Bushi drafted into armies, the right to kill someone for a slight was possible against other non-Samurai in the army if they obtained permission from higher ranks. And some clans had brutal training on par with World War 2 era Imperial Japan that resulted in deaths of not just the conscripted but even proper Samurai including leadership like officers.\n\nSo I'm wondering why the Japanese army of the 1930s and later 1940s, for all their constant boasts about following the Samurai traditions of their forefathers, never had the old sword duels that was the norm among the actual Samurai of the feudal era? Nor did their rank and file esp infantry never had gladiatorial style sparring that resulted in fatalities during unarmed and bayonet and knife training? Since that was a real thing in some of the most warlike and fiercest Samurai clans of the Sengoku period?\n\nIf the logic behind Japanese warcrimes like the 100 man-beheading contest in China that was done by two officers after Nanking was captured was trying to imitate Samurai ancestors, why was there no death duel cultures within Imperial Japan's military? Why push your average drafted citizen in 1941 to the insane warrior lifestyle brutalities that only the most bloodthirsty and hardened Samurai clans would participate in back in the Sengoku (and which most normal Samurai clans wouldn't partake in), if they weren't gonna give them the right to hit another fellow recruited soldier over disrespectful behavior? Why were officers expected to commit suicide but were not allowed to challenge each other to prevent warcrimes or put another officer in his place for insulting your mother?\n\nWhy this inconsistency considering one of the premises behind waging a war in China in 1937 was for warriors glory and for the youngest generation of the time to keep the Bushi tradition alive and honor the Samurai ancestors?",

                    "body": "Japan, despite having several stories and a particularly famous figure in the form of Musashi who is most known for it, doesn't actually have much of a history of honor duels. Dueling is very fleeting in Japan's history, at least in the form of some sort of formal line up and go mano-a-mano to prove who the better man is.\n\nWhere dueling is present, it's less about honor and more about skill. Musashi was not remotely honorable, and even advocated psychological tactics in his Book of Five Rings to throw an opponent off their game. And skill duels are just not useful in a modern military where presumptively every soldier has the same skills.\n\nSo there isn't really an inconsistency at all, except in modern popular culture where duels tend to be a feature of Samurai fiction. This is mostly due to the fame of Musashi, and ignores certain realities; dueling was never really legal in Japan. Even before Tokugawa cracked down on it, many Daimyo had banned it in their domains because most often in Japan at the time duels weren't even about honor or skill, they were about revenge.\n\nJapanese Daimyo really didn't like their vassals running around having bloody revenge feuds and generally tried to discourage it. While many famous duels or acts of revenge became part of Japanese culture, it's kind of like the exaggeration of gun fights in the west. Like gun fights in the west, duels weren't all that common, the culture generally looked down on it in practice while romanticizing it in fiction, and where duels did happen they tended to be a lot more brutal and a lot less fanciful.",

                    "body": "IMHO, bushido and its code are mythologized, both in Japan and by the west.\n\nThey were soldiers of fortune in a great open air concentration camp.  They were honorbound in their own turn, or rather shamebound as firing lowered them to peasant status which they knew was abominable.  Honorbound also in that their families and personal fortunes would suffer greatly any shame they caused, so hostages of honor.\n\nHonor and lofty ideals are not the same thing.  They were not Knights of the Round Table seeking out and correcting injustices at personal peril.\n\nThat wasn't the original question, but really, samurai were like a product which Japanese lords fostered and culled like livestock, making and breaking the rules as they saw fit to keep their forces lean and efficient.  They had songs and stories made for brave, skillful, and dutiful samurai who followed the code to the end or were masters of warfare to promote the self-enforcing code and, frankly, as humble bragging.  My samurai are awesome and blindly loyal.\n\nNotice in films, graphic novels, and other fiction, the admirable samurai is almost always avenging a dead lord or is a fired but honorable ronin, an executioner who wouldn't kill a baby, or some somehow independent actor in a play of recovering honor.  Rarely are they the servants of some current lord, following the kind of cruel orders such lords gave in their time and to protect the lord's honor/fortunes.\n\nWWII Japanese commanders would have had the same motives, to maximize the strength and loyalty of their fighting forces.  And Japanese officers would have gladly likened themselves to the kind of warriors that commanded obsequious obedience from the masses, just as U.S. officers likened themselves to rugged individuals and mavericks of American folklore.\n\nAnyway, again, IMHO.",

Stop watching crappy martial arts films and pick up a book.\n\n>I mean after all honor duels was a staple of Samurai warfare\n\nNope. Honour duels rarely happened, and when they did, many leaders hated them for causing division and getting useful fighters killed.\n\n>Esp since they army tried to imitate other Samurai traditions such as Seppuku suicide, extensive martial arts training (for the standards of contemporary warfare), and deference to the hierarchy?\n\nSuicide is a tradition, but martial arts were part of the Japanese propaganda and self-mythologising, and 'deference to the hierarchy' is something all militaries of the time instilled rigorously.\n\n>So I'm wondering why the Japanese army of the 1930s and later 1940s, for all their constant boasts about following the Samurai traditions of their forefathers\n\nThe 'samurai traditions' were largely invented.\n\n>never had the old sword duels that was the norm among the actual Samurai of the feudal era? \n\nThey were not the norm.\n\n>Nor did their rank and file esp infantry never had gladiatorial style sparring that resulted in fatalities during unarmed and bayonet and knife training?\n\nWhy would you do this and end up losing thousands of soldiers? Japanese martial arts had developed training methodologies (including for the bayonet, with jukendo) that were capable of teaching students without requiring they be seriously injured or killed.\n\n>Since that was a real thing in some of the most warlike and fiercest Samurai clans of the Sengoku period?\n\n*Training* with real steel was a thing, but the vast majority of training was not done with sharps.\n\n>If the logic behind Japanese warcrimes like the 100 man-beheading contest in China that was done by two officers after Nanking was captured was trying to imitate Samurai ancestors\n\nThere was no logic behind it, this is a paper-thin justification for doing a war crime.\n\n>Why push your average drafted citizen in 1941 to the insane warrior lifestyle brutalities that only the most bloodthirsty and hardened Samurai clans would participate in back in the Sengoku\n\nYou are frothing at the mouth.\n\n>Why were officers expected to commit suicide but were not allowed to challenge each other to prevent warcrimes\n\nThe Japanese were not concerned with preventing war crimes.\n\n>Why this inconsistency considering one of the premises behind waging a war in China in 1937 was for warriors glory and for the youngest generation of the time to keep the Bushi tradition alive and honor the Samurai ancestors?\n\nIt's not inconsistent because invoking 'bushido' and the samurai was a deliberate propaganda ploy on the part of the Japanese to instill the 'correct' beliefs in their own soldiers; it's not real, there's no heritage component (certainly not for the vast majority of soldiers who had no samurai heritage), and it's largely made up anyway.",

Generally, while duels are a big feature of Samurai fiction, Samurai history is more tumultuous. Dueling could be framed as a samurai putting his ego before his duty, engaging in useless and bloody personal vendettas, or plain old disorderly conduct. Disturbing the peace if you would.\n\nWhile there's many stories about duels and several famous duelists like Musashi, the legal and cultural status of dueling in Japan is a lot less gushy than it might seem. Many Daimyo banned dueling in the Ashikaga period because it resulted in or from family feuds and vendettas that they didn't want to deal with. It still happened, but it was something that happened in spite of attempts to stop it rather than because it was a celebrated exercise that was encouraged.",

Tiberius himself likewise adopted his successor, Caligula, who was already his adoptive grandson through his father Germanicus. It was not until the assassination of Caligula - who had not named an heir - that his uncle Claudius would become emperor through a process other than adoption (in his case, acclaim by the Praetorians and the Senate).\n\nAnyways, my point is, as long as we recognize the Roman view of adoption, it's clear that they established a hereditary monarchy too, even if they liked to pretend they didn't.",

Thailand had more democratic mechanism, so their leaders can't change much according to their whims, but their king also made actions based on superstitions. Western writers often mocked Lon Nol of Cambodia for his rituals, but he was not uncommon amongst the Cambodian soldiers and leaders. Sihanouk and HunSen had their fair share of superstitious rituals. (True Story) About 10-15 years ago, Hun Sen ordered every \"Chan Flower?\" trees of atype in Phnom Penh cut down, (one in front of the house I'm staying in), because he dreamt that a demon was inside one of them (the cutters' explanation when asked). Recently, a week ago, he arrested one of his personal fortune teller. And a couple ofyears ago, he even changed his birthday citing numerology.\n\nBack to Myanma, the new capital was built in the fortune teller telling the military leader, that his regime will falls if he did not change the capital. There was the legendary 1988 massacres in the 8 day of the 8 month. 08/08/88 get it. Auspicious day, thousands died and the regime continued.",

The Mongols spent most of their resources fighting in China (including their 44 year long war of attrition against the Song Dynasty of southern China), and that was where much of the Mongol power ended up. The Yuan not only controlled the powerful and wealthy kingdoms of what is now considered China (and some surrounding peripheral regions), but also controlled most of the Mongol homelands around what is now Mongolia and southern Russia. \n\nThe Golden Horde lasted the longest (until the 16th century). ",

And I think if you're just answering the question very literally and reductively, that's still the clear answer. But you're correct that, at a certain point, Yuan is less of a \"Mongol successor state\" than it is a Chinese civilization that assimilated its conquerors.\n\nI'm curious if you'd say the same thing about Ptolemaic Egypt. For some reason I feel more comfortable calling that a successor state of Alexander's, but it's pretty clearly the same principle overall.",

                    "body": "I have a lot. \n\nI have a number of brushes with famous - and infamous - people. Whether its Ted Bundy (we believe he was targeting my aunt one day), Bill Gates and Paul Allen (before Microsoft was founded, they were friends with some friends of my parents through the Seattle Computing Club), and one step removals to most of the famous musicians of the 1960s-early 1980s (my dad's former business partner was a music promoter). I went out on dates with the daughters or granddaughters of several nationally - and in one case internationally known - politician.  One of my neighbors growing was a first wave infantry officer on D-Day (at Utah beach). I knew several of the \"Boys on the Boat\" - but they were old men by that time (We found out when the book came out that my step-grandmother briefly dated one of them. A few years later, she was a human computer for the Manhattan project)\n\nDad fought in Vietnam - he was a liaison with the ROK troops.  He later owned a company that - 80+ years before he owned it - supplied clothing to the Alaskan Gold Rush. His Maternal Great-Grandfather supplied rails to the Transcontinental Railroad. \n\nBoth Grandfathers served during WWII. My Maternal Grandfather remembers seeing the Native Americans coming into the town where he grew up in (and both of them ultimately lived) in full headdresses on horseback. My Paternal Grandfather knew the Wright Brothers as a child (his father was a friend of theirs). My Paternal grandfather was also a friend of Charles Lindbergh, and helped to stop a cholera outbreak. \n\nMy Paternal Great-Grandfather fought for the Union in the 107th Pennsylvania Infantry, fighting at (among other places) Second Manassas/Bull Run, South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and ultimately, outside of Richmond at Petersburg, where he was captured on August 13, 1864. He was imprisoned at Libby Prison, and freed on April 1 or 2, 1865. He shook Lincoln's hand on the afternoon or early evening of April 12, 1865. (I have his diaries, so I can narrow down the dates pretty accurately). \n\nGo back a few generations, and I have two Colonial Generals (and one Loyalist Captain) from the American Revolution. A few more generations back (1664, I believe), the first abolitionist society meeting in the US was held at one of my ancestor's tavern in Pennsylvania. Another generation-ish back (1635) and two different branches of my family (one on my maternal line, and one on my paternal line) come over on different ships and wind up in Boston. Because we know that both families sent their boys to the Boston Latin School, and the boys were about the same age, its extremely likely that my great (x something) uncles at least knew each other. \n\nMy mom has the family genealogy back to the 1420s in England and Scotland, and the 1380s in Germany. \n\nFor my spouse's family, there are ancestors who fought against each other during the Civil War, other Revolutionary War officers (and common soldiers). Our Son qualifies for the Sons of the American Revolution through 6 different individuals.",

From the way my dad talked about him he must have been a pretty interesting character; my dad wasn't particularly big on Catholics, but the two of them were apparently friends for years.\n\nThis Catholic Priest happened to have a mutual friend; Muhammad Ali (Another friendship I wish I knew more about; White Priest in Iowa, Famous Muslim Boxer). \n\nSo my dad met Ali through this mutual friend, and Ali took note of him because he showed up in the company van with \"(our family) Commercial Cleaning\" on the side, which wasn't a common sight for a black man in 1968 Iowa.\n\nThey apparently got on well enough (Not sure if he mentioned the Jack Johnson bit) as Ali would call my dad every now and then over the years (Either before I was born or at least old enough to remember).\n\nThe story I always heard was how one of these times in the late 80's or early 90's he called, and my older sister answered, she was probably around 9 or 10 at the time.\n\nShe picks up the phone like \"Hello, who is this?\"\n\n\"Muhammad Ali, I'm looking for your dad\"\n\nBut apparently my sister didn't get the whole story on the photo, because she proceeded to hang up on him, presuming he was a prank caller or something.\n\nMy Dad gets home from work and my sister mentions the phonecall.\n\nDad presumably has a laugh, calls him back, and had my sister apologize for hanging up on the former Heavyweight Champion of the World.\n\nProbably the closest I'll ever be to tangentially being famous.",

The general story is that both victorious countries broke up the post WWI Ottoman empire with no regard to geography or ethnicities and debatably is seen as a root of the regions woes to this day.    \n  \nWhile I hear a lot of just criticism on Sykes-Picot, I've never encountered any book, video or podcast proposing a better idea.  Were there any contemporary or future proposals that would have divided the former empire along better borders whether geographic, ethnic or otherwise?\n\nThe only alternative I'm aware of is Britain's initial promise to then Emir Hussein which promised a \"Greater Arabia\" stretching from Saudi Arabia to Syria, however you could debate if such a state would have similar issues being a conglomeration of different ethnicities and religions.",

So contrary to much of the online discourse, the present-day borders are an alternative to the 1916 secret treaty. Other countries that existed with varying degrees of diplomatic recognition, as well as other solutions were the Kingdom of Hejaz (conquered by the Saudis), the Arab Kingdom of Syria (defeated by the French), T.E. Lawrence's \"Sharifian Solution\", and the several pan-Arabist proposals (Arab Federation, United Arab Republic, the Hashemite Arab Federation, etc.).\n\nI also find the whole discussion about \"better borders\" particularly amusing because very few countries uniquely have the kind of borders that really isolate ethnic groups; i.e. very high mountains and oceans. Moreover, most other borders were created by humans killing each other, and asuming that every place of the earth must follow the pattern established by Europeans after two very destructive wars seems to ignore how widespread ethnic cleansing became in eastern Europe.",

Several hundred years back, there was a category of crime called “petty treason,” (as opposed to high treason) which involved enhanced criminal penalties for crimes involving an inferior committing a crime against their direct superior, like a wife killing her husband or a servant killing their master. The worst possible crime, of course, was high treason; an offense not against the state or the country as a whole like we see treason nowadays, but very specifically an offense against the person of the ruling monarch themselves.\n\nThe whole, huge hierarchy in a system like this was mostly not constructed of voluntary relationships, it was determined largely by birth. And the lowlier a position a person was in in this hierarchy, the more likely they were to be subjected to corporal punishment if they stepped out of line or didn’t know their place. Violence and the threat of violence is a way of keeping rebelliousness down in a hierarchical system where otherwise quite a lot of people might want to rebel or disobey.",

Additionally, the feelings of \"subordinates\" were irrelevant as late as 50 years ago, so it doesn't matter how much pain was inflicted if the child learned math and reading. If you read about education in, say, 19th-Century England, there was constant abuse, both from teachers and from students to one another, because children suffering emotional/physical pain was less important than education and social advancement.",

                    "body": "I like the gist of this question, but it is extremely open ended.  The answer varies tremendously on the place and circumstances.  For example, corporal punishment gradually stopped being used in American schools on a state by state basis over the course of the 20th century, but I think it is still allowed in some states.  It was abolished in England in 1999.  I could be wrong, but I have heard that it was used more frequently in British schools than American schools.\n\nThere is also the question of severity.  The British navy went from severe and sometimes fatal floggings, to lesser forms of corporal punishment such as caning.  A quick wiki search does not yield a definitive answer to when corporal punishment in the British navy really ended.  Authorities can always find ways around restrictions.  Think of Full Metal Jacket, where the sergeant stops punishing a cadet, punishes everyone else instead, knowing that they will do it for him.\n\nIn contrast to capital punishment, there is no bright line indication of when and if corporal punishment ended.  It depends entirely on the circumstances.\n\nEdit:  One additional thought.  As corporal punishment has become less frequent, it has been replaced with restrictions on freedom.  For children, this can mean standing in corner, or missing recess.  For adults in say, prison, it can mean solitary confinement.  I would guess that there are some inmates who would probably prefer a whipping or some other form of torture to a lengthy period in solitary confinement.",

                    "body": "I started school in the UK in 1974 aged 5 and stayed at that school until 1981. The Headmistress was my Grandmothers sister, my Aunt.  \n\nAs a Headteacher she used corporal punishment, For the younger children I think anyone sent to her, or caught by her misbehaving was given a smack or two on the back of the legs.  I certainly did. \n\nFor the 8 to 12 year olds, she had a cane. The cane was  about a metre long, thin and flexible.  She was happy for us all to think that the cane was in regular use, but in fact she hardly every used it.  She would show children the cane so they knew what they were in for. If she did use it there was an accompanying letter home explaining why. She used it on the hands.   Palms up and a couple of strokes on the hands. I'm sure just the threat of it worked. \n\nIn 1982, so not long after I left, and a couple of years before my Aunt retired, she stopped the cane altogether. There had been a court challenge by then around corporal punishment in schools in UK  and the education authority that oversaw the school advised against it. That was Norfolk. \n\nin 1986 the law was changed to stop corporal punishment in all state funded schools.\n\nMy Aunt started teaching in the late 1940s, she was a Headmistress by early 1960s, and worked at that school 1970 to 1984.  Corporal punishment was common place, often thought to be a good thing, and I doubt she would have stopped unless she had to.   I doubt research into the effects of corporal punishment made much difference to her views on it.",

You still got swats with the paddle at school for misbehaving but that was rarely used. I personally never got swatted. All you had to do was mind the teacher and you didn’t have anything to worry about.",

It can be split into:\n\n\\- A shift from corporal punishment to other forms of punishment like fines or prison sentences or grounding children\n\n\\- A more general shift from punishment towards reward, especially for raising children\n\n\\- A shift towards less strict hierarchy, both in families and in society, and less enforcement of hierarchy overall\n\nFor the first two it helps to realize that corporal punishment is *cheap* for the one who administers it compared to the alternatives. Threatening with a stick is more sustainable than giving carrots for compliance. Executing someone once is more sustainable than putting them in prison for life. Cynically one could say the way we organize our society now is a luxury. We do it in part because we can afford it. And the main motive is that we realized the potential evil of building society on strict hierarchy.",

Are you trying to say that because there were richer cultures and more diseases in South America it was different?\n\nWhen the Conquistadors arrived in the Americas there was no comparison to other foreign cultures unlike the Phillipines. Because of that the Conquistidors were much more powerful as an invastion force or almost god-like. While carrying disease with them, as well. Because the Phillipines had already met other cultures they were not decimated in that way.",

But as to how accurate it is in true historical fact... That's another question. For example the goddess nike appears in the engraving, and that's obviously not literally accurate, it's a storytelling device.\n\n\nThe same is (maybe) true for stuff like armor on legionnaires. The armor might be accurate, or it might be used to make sure the audience knows the figures are legionaries. This comes down to legionnaires wearing lorica segmentum, but not lorica have been found in Dacia or the east, so it's unclear if this is historically accurate or basically the equivalent of using costumes to ensure the audience understands the meaning.",

A fairly levelheaded ruler once he came to power. His reign is the beginning of Pax Romana for a reason.\n\n* Hadrian. Hadrian was just a very competent Emperor in general. He didn't make any major innovations, but he took stock of what the Empire had, and made some difficult but ultimately correct decisions to ensure peace and stability for generations. Also very intentionally set up some incredible successors. Three out of the five 'Five Good Emperors' were due to Hadrian's existence. \n\n* Diocletian. Almost single-handedly saved the Empire from collapse. Sure, a lot of the legwork was put in by others (pour one out for Aurelian), but Diocletian was really the man that was able to make things *work.* A lot of people say that Constantine was responsible for breathing life into the Empire, but it was really just Diocletian.",

But it was a flourishing era of rapid cultural change, broadened horizons and had a tremendous literary output (a lot of which is lost, perhaps contributing to it being overlooked). Also a very dynamic era, with the growth and decline of various Hellenistic kingdoms, Rome and Carthage's conflict in the west, and various tribes and other kingdoms from further afield expanding their influence. I find it more interesting than the uniformity and general stability that the early Roman empire brought to much of the ancient world.",

But England was interesting for other reasons, like the scientific progress being made in the period, a flourishing literary output and the radical political developments that appeared during and after the Civil War (such as were discussed at the Putney Debates, these developments had pretty much no parallel in the rest of 17th century Europe, even if they didn't amount to much).",

            "selftext": "Out of all of the many books that they read about with the many different forms of government, I'm sure they could have just gone back to their roots and looked to the UK for inspiration and simply tweaked it. I can understand hating Britian at the time from an american perspective but to not use their government system at all and to make something up completely random that no other country has? Seems like it would be a disaster (and it has been). \n\nFor 1 thing, all positions of power in america are decided by the voters themselves who may not know the ins and outs of what it takes to be in that position of power and what is required. You can be the dumbest person ever, but if you are a smooth talker, then it will be a lot easier to gain that position of power and to trick voters into voting for you. \n\nWith a parliament you have to appease to an elected body of officials who the people elect to represent them and it's those people who will ask you different questions and how qualified you are and they may not be so easy to fool. They are educated as well, so they will know if you are lying or not. With american voters it's a mixed bag and more than likely it's the rural voters who decide things hence the electoral college favoring rural areas over heavily populated ones so you really don't need to study a lot or practice to convince them. Just be a flag waving douche that loves Jesus and hate gay people or something, and you've got it. After all, the rural areas have more voting power, so it's an easy win. \n\nEssentially, voting works in America by forcing voters to choose a person who may be from 1 world or another world of living (rural or city life) and they may not always have a government minded background or they may not come from congress or the house of reps which is an issue. They should be educated in that or come from the government itself at the very least, but they aren't always. I disagree with this completely. With a parliament the official that is running or who is to be elected as prime minister or chancellor or whatnot always comes from the elected body itself instead of them simply being a rogue outsider that knows absolutely nothing about the government. \n\nBut as I said, if you can talk well and you are just dumb and don't know anything then that opens up an opportunity for loud mouths like 24/7 news cycles to speak for you on your behalf which opens up the door for misinformation and  brainwashing which is all too common in America  now. With a parliament, it happens too, but it's not the voters who have to be convinced. It's the elected officials who know what to look for. If you want a comparison, just think of it as electing a house speaker where it's all done internally. \n\nA 2nd thing with america is the electoral college, which favours rural states like I said before. You can have a massive city with a lot of people in it who are always conversing and talking and getting educated and such. However, when they cast their vote, it won't count as much as the hillbilly in the corn fields who has never gone to college, so he gets more representation. You can essentially just gain an infinite amount of Republican seats and positions of power simply by defunding schools and privatizing them so they teach at a sub-par level or at a different standard. Also, by spoon-feeding them news that you approve of and billions of dollars of campaign stuff like ads and such. It's all to brainwash you. Corrupt party A candidate or corrupt party B candidate.\n\nAnother aspect of the electoral college that I hate also has to do with polarization and how the winner-takes-all system does not allow for inclusiveness via more parties to be represented. You can have as many \"grassroots\" movements as possible, but if it's not adopted by either party, then there is 0 chance that anything will happen. The electoral votes simply being handed out in bulk per state was a very poor concept and one that was not expanded on when the constitution was being made and it's one that causes Americans to suffer every day and to lose hope. It's a broken democracy.\n\nThere's other little issues too like any of the 3 governing bodies (executive, judicial, legislative) being able to veto a bill into law or filabuster it even though a majority of the elected body of officials wanted it passed...\n\nBut really, though, it's just a train wreck of a system that was made in a hurry. \n\nSo why didn't the founders implement a parliament? Literally, all of the issues I talked about take care of themselves because parliaments force different parties to work together, and all government positions come from there. My only guess is that the american founders were stupid and simply being hateful and bitter. A 7% tax increase on goods and items sure sounds like a shitty reason to rebel, but they did it anyway. Yay... freedom 🙄",

                    "body": "For many reasons, some of which don’t exist today.\n\n1. The key words in the name of the country is “United States.” While today, it may seem that the states are basically administrative districts, at the time of the founding they were very different entities. There was a lot of tension between the states and many of them were as paranoid about each other as they could. And paranoia about tyranny was huge.\n\n2. You’re grossly underestimating the amount of actually elected people in the federal government, especially at the time of the founding. Basically, your Representative and the President/Vice President were the only positions you actually voted for. SCOTUS was and is appointed by the President and the Senate was generally elected by the state legislature.\n\n3. The President was decided to be separate from Congress as a check. This would be fairly pointless if Congress elected them. Plus, part of the reason that the original Constitution (the articles of Confederation) failed was a weak executive. A strong and independent executive would have been preferable at the time.\n\n4. The idea of a two-party system like today would be quite unbelievable to the founders. James Madison, who helped create the constitution, seemed to believe that parties wouldn’t be a big deal because the US at the time of the founding was crippled by regional interest who often fought other regions for more power. Parties back then were more affiliations of similar minded people and often had major power bloc of regional interests.\n\n5. As to stopping your “hillbilly in the cornfields,” the Electoral College IS your “educated” voter base. There’s nothing in the Constitution that says that states are to allocate their electoral votes on a winner take all popular vote basis. The states pick their electors who then vote on the state’s behalf. The winner take all approach is simply used by most states because it’s democratic.\n\n6. In addition, the distortion in the electoral college is caused by the reform of congressional apportionment in the 1920s. At the time of the first elections, there was a fixed number of people, say X, that affected the number of Congressmen you got. For every X number of people you had, you got another Representative. So states could actually have reasonable ratios. However, by 1920s, this system had broken down. It simply no longer benefited the parties in power to add new seats and the number was making it so they may have to move or expand the House in order to fit everyone, so they capped the house.\n\nSo that’s why.",

                    "body": "Coming to this party late, but there are a few things that haven’t come up yet so I want to share here. \n\nWhen you speak of having a parliament, I’m interpreting that to mean having a Westminster style government, including a separate head of state and head of government, whereby the head of government is a member of the legislative body (parliament) and acts with an executive function within that system, along with a plurality of parties and the need to form coalition governments. Also a little nuance being parliamentary supremacy whereby parliament is the supreme authority rather than a written constitution. Keeping in mind the British constitution, such as it is, is not a single written document and “it” (that is, to speak of it as a single thing) is subject to parliament. \n\nThere’s a very interesting book that came out maybe 10 years ago that made some waves in the field, called Royalist Revolution. The author argued that certain members of the revolutionary generation were rebelling not against the King or the idea of a king (as opposed to “democracy”), but rather, they were rebelling against a tyrannical (to them) parliament, and further, were mad at the King not for being all powerful, but for not exercising his power to check the parliament and protect the colonies. Specifically, they were mad that the King did not exercise his veto (deny royal assent to a law) over unfavorable legislation. The real revolution for the US came with the constitution, which established a unified and powerful executive position in the President. Unified in the sense of being both head of state and head of government (executive branch). The argument against a powerful parliament was that it was made up of people whose interests and loyalties were specific to their represented district, not the entire state. The king, they argued, was the right person to protect and safeguard the whole body politic because his interest was universal and therefore he wasn’t tainted by monied interests, specific constituencies, etc. The fact that he didn’t, led to our form of government. \n\nAs far as the electoral college, yes, it can be seen as a check on the people. But you should also look at everything in our constitution through the lens of slavery and enslaver interests. That’s all still there and we still live with the consequences which are baked in. In parts of the country dominated by enslavers, you had vast numbers of humans who could not vote and would not count. These are largely rural areas, and compared with, say, the north, would never have been able to hold and win national office. Enter, the 3/5’s compromise. Each enslaved person would count, for the purpose of representation, as 3/5 of human, and would therefore contribute to the number of representatives in Congress for slaveholding states. The number of electors granted to the states is equal to the number of representatives and senators in that state. So, like representation, 3/5 of each enslaved person provided a count that would contribute to the number of electors a state got when choosing the president. This would ensure that slaveholding interests were reflected in presidential elections and ensure that the vastly more free populated north / cities would not dominate presidential elections. \n\nThe problem with all of it is that in the course of the life of our governing document, oddly, the tools invented by and for enslavers have proven very useful for people who are able to manipulate them for their own interests. The system works very well for the parties and the powerful. You are right to be angry and these are good questions to ask.",

Most of the so-called \"framers\" would not have considered the aspects that bother you to be a problem, although similar to your thinking, they also believed that the average voter was too dumb [I disagree]; hence the electoral college.\n\nNowadays, newly independent countries do not look to the U.S. constitution for inspiration (no one else chooses the head of government via an electoral college, and first-past-the-post voting leads to more polarization than proportional voting). What was once a revolutionary document is older than most nations on earth. I just can't imagine that implementing proportional representation, switching to multi-member districts, or stopping gerrymandering are likely to happen, but that is up to people in the United States to decide.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I guess a modern day nation state that would meet that definition would be Israel, although I don't think Israelis would want to be likened to Prussians.  I think Finland has met that criteria as well.\n\nIt's important to remember that both Sparta and Prussia paid a price for maintaining their militaries.  Both had a large peasant/serf/slave class that often went hungry so that there would be more resources for the military.  I don't think that would be true of Israel or Finland.",

For instance the Chaos after the French Revolution and in the lead up was highly romanticised for a long time, with stories of spies and treachery both real and fictional (Scarlet Pimpernel).\n\nEvery country has their own version of this you may not be aware of. For instance in Australia Ned Kelly the bushranger who is quite like a Wild West figure like Jesse James, is highly romanticised.\n\nAlso as someone pointed out, adventures and treasure seeking and violence in colonial countries like Africa and South America used to be massively romanticised before that became un PC.",

After the west started to be colonized by Europeans, there really was not that much violence.  There were small wars against the natives and some terrorism between settlers fighting over land.  This was wholly unrelated to the Civil War.  \n\nSaying World War One led to crime and violence during prohibition is a bizarre leap in logic.  The economic depression and prohibition itself easily explain the rise in organized crime.",

Conflicts with a strong ideological element like the Russian Civil War might be a strong contender as you could easily have members of a given community who eventually side with different factions, although of course if class is a strong factor its likely that most members of your immediate family are part of the same socio-economic class as you.",

The ones that have caught my eye are:\n\nRichard the Lionheart: The Crusader King of England by W. B Bartlett\n\nLionheart and Lackland by Frank Mclynn\n\nRichard I by John Gillingham\n\nAre any of these good or should I buy a different one, I'm currently leaning towards W.

When I brought up ideas about stopping the holocaust or whatever, he corrected me. Nobody in America really knew about the holocaust until they got to Germany and started digging up the mass grave in concentration camps. Even if there may have been reports... all the normal person knew was that Hitler was this crazy guy who wanted to control all of Europe and their nearest comparison was 100% Napoleon.\n\nMaybe people don't like that comparison, but do they not like that comparison because of what we found out *after* we conquered Germany? For the people at the time, Hitler was a crazy dictator with ambitions of conquering many nations. You can just name people who did atrocities... but does that actually answer your question as it was posed?",

His campaigns were characterized by traditional warfare rather than the systematic genocide or mass extermination seen under figures like Hitler or Stalin.\n\nThe scale of warfare during Napoleon’s time, though brutal and extensive was more aligned with the norms of military conflict of the era, which included battles, sieges, and warfare between nations. This contrasts with ideological campaigns that specifically targeted civilians, such as the Holocaust or Stalin’s purges.\n\nWhile estimates vary, the total death toll from the Napoleonic Wars (including combat, disease, and starvation) is often placed in the range of 3.5 to 6 million. Although this is a significant number, it does not reach the scale often associated with other figures on similar lists.\n\nIf you were to just cross reference most evil and most killed prior to Hitler though going back in time sequentially from WWII, it’s Stalin. That would be the most recent. But not everyone around the world would give that answer prior to WWII due to what I explained in the first paragraph.",

Allowing the Heretical Protestants to campaign in Spain, and even, just barely, naming Wellington Generalissimo. \n\nExtra points for his being the leader of \"the bad side\" during the \"first WWI\" before we started numbering them.",

Nero, Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan were all horrors of their time and so pre-ww2 (early 1900s) wouldn't really have perceived them as being horrific. Much of the horror of Hitler is that it happened so recently with modern technology; the horror was that we had lied to ourselves and weren't all that far removed the savageness of pre-civilization Homo sapiens. Numbers wise ancient warlords definitely compare to Hitler, but the horror of it all probably belongs to the Belgian Congo.",

And it seems to have lingered on for another generation at least.\n\nBoney being not the disco-funk group known for their unforgettable song \"Rasputin,\" but the original Boney himself -- Napoleon Bonaparte.  Public figures in 20th century Britain would sometimes talk about how they had been \"threatened with Boney\" as children, usually before the Second World War.\n\nAlthough someone who is still alive was also recently talking about it, saying they had an old and quite traditional nanny growing up and may have been the last British child to ever have been threatened with Bonaparte.  Unfortunately I have forgotten who it is and google is no help.\n\nBut I guess you can say it still exists in living memory?\n\n(Also Richard Adams makes an oblique reference to the concept in the epilogue to *Watership Down*, in which young rabbits for generations to come are said to be threatened that \"the General will get them\" if they don't behave -- although to be fair the character of Woundwort didn't just represent Napoleon, but probably every tyrant and would-be conqueror of Britain.)",

A brilliant strategist on and off the battlefield, was able to fix some of the excesses of the French Revolution, but then decided he should be the Emperor.",

He would have been held in low regard by almost every Russian neighbor for maybe a century after he reigned.  \n\nInternally, he killed tens of thousands as he also pushed to modernize Russia.  Note that \"modernize\" doesn't mean a shortcut to modern ways of the 21st century, but simply some of the first steps in trying to emulate and embrace ideas from Europe.  He was a fan of assasinations of internal competition and those who didn't meet his standards of loyalty.  He sacked his own cities.  \n\nAs often happens, the dead grow quiet, and the living who benefit tend to say \"well the ends justified the means, especially since it happened to other people's ancestors and not mine.\"  Some folks like to paint him as a strong but necessarily stern leader.  Burning and sacking his way to the Enlightenment!   Personally he seems like a shit as well.  He's a man who managed to kill off his best heirs through fits of rage and violence at home, for example.  \n\nAll of this is independent of the western propaganda, and the rather ambiguous nature of the word \"Terrible\" in English.  \"He blinded his architect so he could never design for others!\"  No. The West painted him as a monster.  He was man, but he posed for the portrait quite well.  \n\nOutside of eastern europe he never had the same longevity and stature as say, Attila or Chengis.",

Not so much in terms of him being regarded as embodying evil (France was quite proud of him) as for having been the most recent warlord conqueror who indiscriminately destroyed the status quo without regard for ruin and suffering along the way, for no particular reason other than for visions of glory and conqest. For example, I own a novel from the 1920s titled *The Red Napoleon*. It interprets the (then) new Soviet Union and its \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" using the French Revolution, Jacobins, Robespierre, and guillotine Terror as reference points. It then proceeds to imagine a fictional Red Army general overthrowing the ideologues of Trotsky, Stalin, and the Politburo to invade and conquer the countries of Europe in a Communist replay of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nBasically, things that didn't happen, but people expected it as possible because at the time, Napoleon Bonaparte was precedented, whereas Mustache Man and the Windmill of Friendship hadn't happened yet.",

It didn't sit well with me (which is probably why the little claim stuck in my brain), because it's not like the Pharaoh was really evil, even in the Bible, and there were plenty of worse people since him, but I think he was just the most well-known \"bad guy\" that was around.  After all, believe it or not, some rancher in Montana in 1875 might not have heard of Nero or Napoleon, but he will have heard about the Pharaoh or Herod.",

When informed of how bad it was in Bengal, he just asked \"why isn't Gandhi dead yet?\".\n\nFor the Chinese, Emperor Hirohito and Hideiki Tojo are about as bad as Hitler, if not worse. \n\nIt's about perspective, not about being before Hitler.",

But most of the world didn't care and he was never as deeply hated as Hitler. \n\nWinston Churchill indirectly compared Hitler to Napoleon in a famous speech, in reference to Napoleon's failed plans to invade England.\n\n>When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone, “there are bitter weeds in England.” There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned. So I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our Island Home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.",

To say nothing of the fact he wasn't really as *bad* as Hitler to everyone else.\n\nOutside of those places where his legacy is viewed as a positive factor, Napoleon had a reputation as a sometimes very brutal despot and demagogue, whose armies were responsible for toppling regimes and installing new puppet monarchies. He was sometimes considered a megalomaniac who aimed to conquer the entire world, for no other reason than his ego. And, in the other European monarchies, Napoleon was associated with the often excessive brutality of the French revolution, and all the violence of \"the Terror\" that went with it.\n\nUnlike Hitler, it should be said that Napoleon wasn't really all bad, of course. But before Hitler, he was in many ways the Arch-Villain of Europe, and before the full extent of his regime's depravity was uncovered, Hitler was often seen as a Napoleon wannabe, with a chip on his shoulder about conquering the world.",

Every modern nation can look back in its own history and find its own version of Hitler limited to its own country. Spain had Isabella and the Inquisition. England had Henry VIII, Thomas Moore, Thomas Cromwell and Mary Tudor. But in terms of pre-Nazi autocrats with influence beyond traditional national boundaries, it's a small group of people. Really you're looking at Napoleon Bonaparte, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, and Alexander the Great. Were any of them genocidal, came to power on a wave of popular belief in racial superiority, or so brutal and ruthless against enemies both real and imagined? I'm not enough of an expert in any of them to say. But maybe! 🤷",

We have journals from victims from pretty much every stage of nazi Germany, photographs, and official nazi documents. \n\nCombine that with the fact that almost everyone on Earth was affected by WWII and that Germany was an easy nation to blame it on and you have the perfect recipie for a \"Hitler.\" Relatively few Germans were willing to defend Hitler after the war so it eliminated the need to ambiguity.

His soldiers would go hunting and take a hand to make up for the bullet. A clerk in London discovered the crimes when he noticed ships coming in from the Congo were loaded with Ivory and rubber and metals and art and the ships going back to the Congo carried bullets and guns. \n\nLeopold is hardly mentioned despite how horrific his Congo was.

Atilla, or Ghengis Khan...\n\nThe thing is, there have been a lot of really evil leaders throughout history.  If you take any 100 year slice of history, there were probably 10+ leaders worldwide who were complete murderous / torturous assholes (totally pulled that number out of my ass, but you get the point).  Hitler was just the first one to industrialize it on that scale.  Bullets were becoming too expensive, so he needed a more efficient way to kill people in mass.  AFAIK no one had actually set out with a goal of killing MILLIONS of people at one time and had been so brutally successful at it.\n\nAfter him we see Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, etc who killed on a similar scale (sometimes larger), but while they are by no means innocent, their numbers come from a lack of respect of life, rather than as a goal.  Human life at modern scale just got in the way of their goals, so mass death was a means to an end.\n\nAnyway, humans have always been shitty.  We still are.  Post-WW2 western peace has granted us the luxury to forget that.  Look at any nation's history, though, and the jackass they overthrew to take control of their own lives.\n\nHitler's an outlier, but not unique.",

The amount of factual horrors and propaganda released to the European and North American public’s at that time would be unrivalled on the worlds stage to that point. Not only this but also at this time global literacy rates shot up significantly, making the news, and print media much more accessible than its ever been. To this day, Nazis are used as stock bad guys in movies, and I feel as if there is not a person held similarly to Hitler in history because of this. There has never been a more effective or more long standing propaganda campaign demonizing (rightfully so) anyone in history, and the reason for this is because it simply was never a possibility before.",

I don't know if some of the protagonists were hated as much as Hitler though, but I can imagine they were. So depending on your region you might hate King Gustav Adolph of Sweden or Wallenstein. The later was strongly hated by his contemporaries.",

In a sense it was a bit like Hadrian using nuclear tactics.  In reality he was some pos trading lions and tigers to fight to the death in coliseums alongside slaves for mobs and had no better cause than the Judeans revolting mainly cause they hate gays cause a guy said an alien told them to on a volcano.  He had no ethical caussus belli, and even though the Judean polity didn’t either, in this instance taking it out on towns and villages whose own populace had been terrorized by bar Kokbha (the guy tortured and killed those not fighting against the gays and other groups and other groups they said the alien told them on the volcano to hate, and apparently had all his soldiers chop off one of their fingers as a mark of loyalty).  There was clearly an opportunity for the Romans to use their words here, and their academics, to counter the volcano alien crew and otherwise get things done without killing everyone just trying to sell some olives and teach their kid how to skip rope and give or take didn’t have any interest in lion and tiger and slave fights nor killing the gays on behalf of alleged gay hating aliens that talked to guys on volcanoes.  Long story short: whole thing could have been prevented with valuing human life enough to think and speak clearly regarding volcanoes, give or take.\n\nBut ya, Hadrian massacred / mass murdered hundreds of thousands in towns and villages to put down a revolt by a bunch of guys who claimed to talk to aliens on a volcano because they felt they needed to trade lions and tigers to fight slaves in coliseums\n\nStill, while I’d read of the whole mass murder of towns and villages, and the razing of them to the ground, I did in fact get it wrong in the sense of it being after the revolt had been formally defeated.  These mass murders happened during, for the most part.",

While Kasa-Vubu's speech was protocolary and free of controversies, Lumumba's speech, which he had already watered down with the help of others, caused the Belgian delegation to claim to be offended and further ceremonies were stopped.\n\nYou are free to search for other translations of Lumbumba's Congolese Independence Speech. I found [this translation](https://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/lumumba/1960/06/independence.htm) on marxists.org. Despite the lack of criticism of the dead king, these are some of the paragraphs that offended the Belgians:\n\n> No Congolese will ever forget that independence was won in struggle, a persevering and inspired struggle carried on from day to day, a struggle, in which we were undaunted by privation or suffering and stinted neither strength nor blood. It was filled with tears, fire and blood. We are deeply proud of our struggle, because it was just and noble and indispensable in putting an end to the humiliating bondage forced upon us.\n> \n> That was our lot for the eighty years of colonial rule and our wounds are too fresh and much too painful to be forgotten. We have experienced forced labour in exchange for pay that did not allow us to satisfy our hunger, to clothe ourselves, to have decent lodgings or to bring up our children as dearly loved ones.",

Even for regular people, accounts from the period describe the period during the Taiping Rebellion as a literal apocalypse on earth. So yeah, Hong Xiuquan absolutely deserves to be on the conversation as the worst human being in history.",

He was \"might makes right\" personified, but not Hitleresque at all in terms of motivation. In fact, the Mongol Empire under Temujin was far, far more tolerant of different religions and ethnicities than literally anywhere in Europe in that same time period.",

I'm pretty sure, and a quick google search availed me that Victorinus of Pettau plus Sulpicius Severus interpreted the book this way, and I believe even Tacitus found Nero's treatement of Christian repugnant (and he hated Christians) so I doubt the Christians would have owed Nero any more endearment",

Mongolian history is fascinating, but the revisionist history on Genghis is very stronk these days. It's of course a reaction to the \"Mongolian Horde\" stereotypes of 100 years ago that mainstream historians accepted, but still seems to lessen the suffering of millions of people who Genghis killed. Here's a counter-factual to think about: If Hitler won WW2, historians a thousand years from now could make a huge laundry list of all the supposed innovations and changes to society that we went through afterward and how humanity was forever changed with new science no one had ever seen before, and yes of course he also killed millions of people which isn't too good...\n\nThat's kinda what revisionist historians are doing with Genghis now. Yeah, they definitely were not racist you can give the Mongolians that. If anything they were the opposite. Yet, still brutally killed tens of millions, at least close 100million people. Subjugated countless more people than that. Millions of rapes. Dozens or hundreds of cities leveled and destroyed. The population of Baghdad recovered to pre-Mongolian levels in the 20th century. \n\nGenghis Khan absolutely belongs in the same bucket as Hitler imo. He may have caused more suffering than anyone else who has lived in a single lifetime. And perhaps through is many sons as well. He was simply so victorious, and these events long ago, that they don't have the brutal emotional impact as something like the Holocaust does to us. \n\nThere is a viciously horrific film called \"Come and See\" about the SS \"Holocaust by bullet\" in Belarus. It's titled that because to the people of that land, when the Nazis came to kill everyone in your village, and everyone in the next village over, it was like the book of Revelation. The pale horse of death come to announce the end of the world. \n\nContemporary Islamic people thought the same thing about the Mongolians in the 11th century. Their society was brutally destroyed so badly that it was commonly believed to be the End of the World as described in the Abrahamic scriptures. Massacres on a scale you and I couldn't believe. Mostly committed by hand. \n\nIf you lived through that, you'd spit in the face of someone saying Hitler was worse.",

However that does not mean a smaller movement of people did not occur. Very few historians talk in absolutes and I have never read anyone talk of conclusive proof that Exodus did not occur but simply that on the balance of evidence it's unlikely. I  would love a link to whoever you are quoting saying this so I can look at their argument.",

There's a reason the question in this post is phrased in the way it is.  \n\nIndustrial slaughter of humans has happened exactly once in history.  There is just so much in the moral details of the Nazi machine that make it unique and uniquely evil.  \n\nYou're right to say that revisionists are wrong to rehabilitate Genghis Khan's image.  You're right to say that people thought it was the end of the world when he came for them.  But you actually undermine your attempt to equate him with Hitler through your choice of examples.  \n\nThe murder of Communist Partisan Christians in Belarus by the SS may have been comparable to how Muslims conquered by the Great Khan felt.  (Death on a Pale Horse is a Christian idea from *Revelation,* which is a Christian book.)  But here's the thing: people don't readily associate Hitler with his crimes against Belarusian Soviet Partisan villages, now do they? Why, because just in Belarus, what he did to the Jews was much *worse*!",

I think he did some horrific things; his use of war as a form of diplomacy was, even at the time, seen as outrageous, but he also seeded some of the more positive actions of the French Revolution throughout Europe.\n\nFrankly his biggest blunder was abandoning his office of First Consul and an orderly French Republic and declaring himself Emperor, which wrecked his reputation with many reformers who had seen him as a powerful symbol of the sweeping away of the old European order. It undermined one of the more potent symbols of his rise to power, an outsider who stared down the Paris Mob and ultimately the Directory, who would remake Europe in the egalitarian revolutionary image. Instead he became just another dictator wanting to grasp at the trappings of aristocracy and absolutism that had led to the downfall of the Bourbons. Whatever moral authority he held for ending the French Revolution was spent when he placed the crown on his head, and thoroughly eviscerated by marrying a Habsburg in some twisted replay of Louis XVI.",

If an emperor was unpopular, historians would ascribe all kinds of negative traits and stories post mortem to make them look bad. \n\nSo while Nero probably did a lot of uncool stuff, it's important to bear in mind our view of him is heavily influenced by Christian religious propaganda and the biased, only partially factual writings of Roman historians.",

In the 1790s, and especially in 1806, France had turned the Netherlands, Italy, and western Germany into French territory or client states. \n\nA France which was this powerful wasn't acceptable to the other major powers, and especially Britain, which needed a balance of power in Europe to pursue its mercantile and colonial efforts. Most of the coalitions of the 1800s and 1810s were efforts to restore this. You can tell this was true because of what happened in the Congress of Vienna: the five nation balance of power was restored, and territorial losses were generally accompanied with gains elsewhere.\n\nNapoleon did not start any coalition wars, but he made them inevitable by making France a little bit larger after every one of them, instead of trying to calm the situation down and make a balanced continent after a disruption in the international order, which is what Bismarck did in the 1870s and 1880s. I doubt his pride and ambition would have allowed him to relinquish gains after a victory for the sake of a lasting peace.",

                    "body": "Well, let's put it this way, he considered French Jews to be French. They, like the Church, needed to be properly organized (Napoleon loved to organize things). He was skeptical of Judaism, but then again, he was skeptical of the Church as well. If he treated Jews like everyone else, it's because Napoleon had a rather singular expectation of all French citizens; Jew, Catholic, Protestant (which were rarer in France than Jews), that they obey the law.\n\nTo the Napoleon, the concept of a lower class of citizen or some kind of non-citizen in his French state was simply not thinkable. Since religious matters, other than where they served his purposes, didn't seem to intrude on his mind, in a way he became, so far as freedom of conscience and belief, a surer guardian of \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité!\" than his Revolutionary predecessors.\n\nFor the Jews of Napoleonic France, there had never been anyone like Napoleon. Not even in the relative tolerant atmosphere of the Dutch Republic, there was still a latent anti-Semitism, taking the form of an almost paternalistic view of Jews; that they shouldn't be persecuted, but rather encouraged through kindly ministrations and vigorous public debate to convert. Napoleon held no such views. French Jews were French, and so long as they saw themselves first as French, then he had no interest in conversion, forced, coerced or even recommended. He really was an utterly unique creature. Where his Revolutionary predecessors had talked a great game, Napoleon was as close to color blind as any European ruler had achieved to that time.",

He isn’t a match, and this isn’t a new development in biblical criticism…this is old news.

Modern Academic Estimates seem in accordance with Dio of the time - about 500k-600k Jewish dead “by the sword” (not so called “indirectly” by famine or disease).  \n\nGiven Bar Kokbha was commanding nowhere near 500-600k soldiers, nor were did anywhere near this number of soldiers under him die in battle…we’re talking in that region of 500k civilians killed by the Romans “by hand” given the weaponry of the time in a war of total annihilation, followed by mass enslavement and deportation.\n\nSeems the numbers of so called “militiamen” in the sense of Bar Kokbhas army seems to essentially mean “Jewish male” meaning give or take it’s just saying all the Jewish men in the region were considered military members and the Roman policy was to kill them and their families, which basically meant “kill everyone.”  (Kokbhas  personal guard / unit was 12000 but “militia” around 3-400k, meaning basically all males in the region)\n\nThe “kill everyone other than those we make slaves” policy is what I describe as Mass Murder, and it’s clear Hadrian (and it seems bar Kokbha or many historians for that matter) made no distinction whatsoever between civilian and combatant.  In that sense yes, it was a mass murder but you’re right in the sense the full 500-600k may be considered an overestimation as to be included in the murders themselves rather than course of battle.  The number of murdered would surely be in the hundreds of thousands though, so i stand corrected on my initial statement.  I’d say number of murdered high end estimate would be 500k, low end 2-300k",

The Chinese government made intentional efforts to stoke division amongst the tribes and ensure they remained a minor frontier threat. Genghis Khan unified these tribes into one political unit based on merit and not birth. He brought an end to the tribal conflicts that had plagued the steppe for centuries. To Genghis Khan, unity meant peace, division meant constant conflict. Bringing the world under one rule, the Pax Mongolica, would be the ultimate expression of that, a world of open and safe trade and travel, of freedom of religion, and a new society built on merit not birth was worth the price of building it in his eyes, and any who resisted were supporters of the old status quo and thus fair game for destruction",

US/UK installed a puppet monarch who was too unhealthy to resist the Islamic revolution, and instead ran away. A great society ruined by Western greed.",

They closed down and outlawed the schools of stoicism and the platonics, and the western world forgot about plato and other greek philosophers. The muslims rediscovered these works in the middle ages and translated them into arabic. They then spread throught the caliphate and later back into europe. ",

Not a stretch to imagine they’d take care of each other - I know they were (probably) expected to pay for each other’s burials and such)\n\nA pile of hands, especially left in the open, would have a slim chance if any to be preserved in any way. I also don’t think much archeology has focused on the site, but that’s just going off a Google search",

There’s apparently a Zoroastrian revival movement going on among the Iranian youth right now who are sick of the mullahs, but Iran’s been majority Shia Muslim since the death of Hussein—that’s not to say Shi’ism doesn’t have more Zoroastrian influence than other Islamic sects, but most devout Shia Muslims will deny it vociferously. It would be like a Catholic acknowledging that some of the saints were facsimiles of pagan gods. \n\nMossadegh’s ouster was undoubtedly an abuse of power by the UK and US, but the idea that parliamentary democracy and secularism would have thrived in Iran otherwise is equally a mistake—this wasn’t a country with robust democratic institutions. There wasn’t a strong middle class. The Islamists and communist (Tudeh) factions were forming power bases under Mossadegh; one of the supreme hypocrises of the mullahs is that they actually backed the CIA during the coup against Mossadegh, then decided to overthrow the Shah a couple decades later when he was too middle of the road for them- (authoritarian but secularist and moderate) guy wouldn’t stop glorifying the Achaemenids and didn’t say his prayers ostentatiously enough. \n\nMossadegh himself was playing an increasingly dangerous game of brinkmanship with the West—he kept threatening to align himself with the Soviets, purged monarchist military officers and administrators, and basically did things that alarmed not only the British but the conservative establishment forces in Iran; the guy was almost certainly doomed to face a coup or a civil war whether the West was involved or not, and he and the left-wing forces that backed him were probably doomed to lose. He wasn’t another Ataturk who had the backing of left nationalist secular officers in the military.\n\nBasically, the narrative about the UK/US coup is somewhat true, but not the whole truth; it’s a simplistic narrative that a lot of Western anti-imperialists and Muslims like to latch onto to justify condemnation of the West, while ignoring a hundred other factors that were in play.",

That was the problem with the Julio-Claudians, it had some brilliant rulers; Julius Caesar, Augustus, even Tiberius despite his personal oddities and scandalous behavior, and Claudius was no dolt either (despite the reputation). But when they went sour, and Caligula and Nero seemed to have been in the latter category, whatever coins they may have flung to the mob, it still left notoriety in its wake.\n\nThe measure of Roman emperors was always whether they promoted policies that maintained law and order. Yes, by that definition, policies that helped the aristocracy inevitably were seen as positive, but Rome wasn't a modern government, and even during the Republic, the democratic institutions were not representative in any sense. All the Roman rulers either placated the mob, or faced large scale disorder, so how Nero was different than his predecessors in this regard seems more like a distinction without a difference. Nero's reign was chaotic, he used a combination of state largess and state oppression, and like Caligula before, threatened public order and the unity of Rome.",

On the other hand, the Persians quickly differentiated themselves after a period of Arab rule, and there’s good reason to believe the Persians were the movers and shakers behind the Abbasid Caliphate. From what I’ve read, there’s definitely aspects Shi’ism that make it distinct from Sunni sects, and a lot of it could be traced back to Zoroastrianism. But I’d have to do some more research. Islam’s a lot like Protestantism in that it’s strictly monotheistic and very hostile to anything that smacks of idolatry; Zoroastrian influences would have to be kind of subtle. \n\nThey might go to secular leaders *now*. I read an estimate the other day that said support for the mullahs only stands at about 30%. The theocracy in Iran knows this, and the mullahs have regularly been using violent and repressive measures to maintain their rule. Gunning down protesters on a semi-regular basis isn’t the sign of a healthy or self-confident regime. And like I was talking about earlier, a Zoroastrian revivalist movement among the kids is a sign of the times—they’re not only moving towards secularism, they’re rejecting Islamic culture altogether to hearken back to Iran’s glory days under the Sassanids, Parthians, and Achaemenids. I met a Persian guy a while back in London while I was checking out the Mithraeum there—he and I shared a smoke and we talked a little bit, he was definitely more interested in the old Persian soldier-god export than adherence to Islamic piety.",

The letters of the alphabet functioned also as numerals. If one adds up the letters of the name Neron Caesar (spelled in Hebrew, which used the “n” for the ending of the name), the sum is 666.\n\n\n\n>This also makes sense of a textual variant here found in certain ancient manuscripts. Some scribes, thinking of the name as it would appear in Greek rather than Hebrew (and thus without that one “n”), changed the number to 616, which would be the correct addition of the letters of the name spelled in Greek. Thus we know that at least those ancient scribes also took the number to be a reference to Nero",

                    "body": "To be precise, it wasn't simply that Britain had financial troubles and that these directly caused the American Revolution.  It was the larger system of mercantile colonial economics that the mid-Atlantic colonies were sick of.  The financial reckoning after the Seven Years' War simply showcased this problem and gave the colonists a rallying cry.\n\nKeep in mind that at the very beginning of the revolution -- when it was still just in the category of rebellion -- it was still possible that sufficient political reform of colonial representation and colonial policy could have stifled enough of the revolutionary fervor to end the fighting.\n\nBut Britain chose not to do that and it's not hard to see why -- the whole point was exploitation.  If you give the colonies a say over that, they will choose not to be exploited anymore.\n\nInstead, once the ~~eighteen~~ ~~twelve~~ ~~four~~ ~~thirteen~~ ~~twelve~~ ~~thirteen~~ fourteen mid-Atlantic colonies who joined the rebellion got their act together and declared full independence, it took no more than a year to make it clear to Britain that there was no point in spending more on these colonies than they would have made through their policies.\n\nIt wasn't that Britain was broke, exactly.  By 1777 it had been a decade and a half since the Seven Years' War. But they definitely did not want to sink money into what had been intended as a profitable mercantile exploitation, not what we would today refer to as \"a cost center\" as it was fast becoming.\n\nIn fact you could argue that it was precisely *because* Britain was so prudent in evaluating this situation and surrendering that they were in good financial shape in another generation when Napoleon came along.\n\nI mean there is a reason they maintained these profitable mercantile colonial revenue sources.  It made them bank.\n\nLately it has become fashionable to argue that because colonialism was bad then it must also have been unprofitable and stupid.  But that was not really true at all, at least in the case of Great Britain.  British net national wealth grew massively because of mercantilist colonial policies.\n\nAs long as they didn't have to fight rebellions for it too often!",

This increased the overall wealth of the country and made it easier to fund the war.\n\n* Naval Dominance: The Royal Navy's dominance of the seas allowed Britain to control trade routes and protect its own shipping while disrupting French trade. This contributed to the British economy and helped fund the war effort.\n\n* Strategic Alliances: Britain formed alliances with other European powers, such as Prussia and Austria, who also had an interest in containing France. This shared the financial burden of the war.\n\n* War Profits: While war is devastating, it can also create opportunities for profit.

Britain was no different. The costs were kept extremely high so only aristocrats could afford them. The Crown made enough money off of commissions to cover the cost of soldiers pay and basic rations. In return the officers were given access to a whole list of ways they could personally profit from the war, which they usually took full advantage of. So all the Crown needed to provide in order to wage war was equipment like ships, cannons, wagons, rifles, etc.. That significantly reduced the amount of money needed for the Crown to fight a war.\n2. In 1812 (that year came up in my search for Revolutionary War stats some reason) the British had over 1400 ships of the line. Ships were the most complicated and expensive pieces of equipment to build at the time. Yes, they probably had less ships during the 7 Years and Revolutionary Wars, but the point is that the British had a great deal more resources globally than they did just in America. You have to remember that the British still had troops in Europe, Asia, and Africa the whole time they were getting their asses kicked in America.\n3. The British took a financial loss from the 7 years and Revolutionary Wars, but they were able to pay their debt off in just 70 years. By the time the Napoleonic Wars started they had already paid almost 1/3 of the debt, and they still had massive amounts of global assets. So, bankrolling Britain in a war at that time was probably the safest financial investment on the planet.",

                    "body": "While that's true, it's also important to remember that the thirteen colonies did not initially revolt all at once. Massachusetts, followed by New England, revolted first, in April 1775. They were only joined later by the rest of the thirteen colonies, in July 1776.\n\nAnd it was those other colonies where slavery, Indian settlement, and landowners wanting to expand their power were motivating factors for joining New England's revolution. In particular, Virginia had the most to gain on these issues, since elite Virginians had formed the royally-sanctioned Ohio Company, which was a real estate monolopy authorized to negotiate with the Indians and then sell western lands to European colonists.\n\nMassachusetts' and New England's motivations were almost diametrically the opposite. They revolted because A) their colonial charters (specifically, Massachusetts') laid out that taxes could only be assessed on the colonists if the Massachusetts legislature gave approval, which they did not, because B) they saw the Seven Years War as primarily for the benefit of Virginia and the crown. It was not to Massachusetts' benefit, since their borders were already fixed. Virginia started the French and Indian War so as to remove France from the land that the Ohio Company was authorized to sell. Then Parliament tried to get Massachusetts colonists to pay for it, even though there were no New Englanders who stood to benefit, and they had only sent their militia to help fight when the crown asked them to.\n\nOn top of that, the Massachusetts legislature was making moves to try to get slavery banned in the colony; in the 1760s, they had passed a law banning further imports of enslaved people into the colony, only for that law to be vetoed by the royally-appointed governor. They then tried to get the 1772 [*Somerset v. Stewart*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_v_Stewart) ruling enforced in their colony as well (which had recognized slavery as illegal in Great Britain), only to be rebuffed by the British courts, that the ruling only applied to England.\n\nIt was only with Parliament's heavy-handed response (the \"Intolerable Acts\") to Massachusetts' protests before any of the colonies south of Connecticut agreed to get involved. And they primarily got involved because they feared what you said: that *Somerset* would eventually get applied to the colonies and slavery would be outlawed. And also, one of the Intolerable Acts was the Quebec Act, which had awarded the Indian lands back to Quebec, which pissed off Virginia, since it took away the power/wealth of the Ohio Company that had been the core reason for Virginia starting the French and Indian War.",

                    "body": "> The funny bit is that Britain could have given representation to the colonies at very little cost to itself -- create, say, 13 (or even just 5) new seats in Parliament, let the colonies have absolutely trivial political effects, add some taxes to the colonies, and call it a day. Those colonial seats could be important in winning narrow votes, but that's about it.\n\nThat's not what the colonies wanted, though. People misunderstand the \"No taxation without representation\" thing. The colonists were *not* saying, \"No taxation until we get representation in Parliament\". They were saying \"Taxation should only happen in the legislative body where we have representation, which is in our colonial legislatures.\"\n\nTheir argument was that their colonial charters *already* gave them the right to control their own tax policy. Most specifically, in Massachusetts, where the revolution began, their [colonial charter](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/mass07.asp) at the time granted their legislature (called the General Court) the \"full power\" to tax the residents of the colony, which was signed by representatives of the King:\n\n> \"...And we do for us, our Heirs, and Successors, Give and grant that the said General Court or Assembly shall have full power and Authority to...impose and levy proportionable and reasonable Assessments, Rates, and Taxes upon the Estates and Persons of all and every the Proprietors and Inhabitants of our said Province or Territory to be Issued and disposed of by Warrant under the hand of the Governor...\"\n\nGranting the colonies seats in Parliament undermined their whole argument, that their colonial legislatures were *co-equal* with Parliament *already*, and that Parliament had a legal duty to uphold the terms of the charter.\n\nThe Americans laid this all out at the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, when the delegates drafted their [Declaration of Rights and Grievances](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Rights_and_Grievances), which included:\n\n> 3rd. That it is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people, and the undoubted rights of Englishmen, that no taxes should be imposed on them, but with their own consent, given personally, or by their representatives.\n\nBy \"*their* representatives\", the Americans are saying the tax authority rightly lies with their local representatives in the colonial legislatures, which is even more explicit in the document's 5th article:\n\n> 5th. That the only representatives of the people of these colonies are persons chosen therein, by themselves; and that no taxes ever have been, or can be constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective legislatures.\n\nBased upon this asserted right, in the 8th article, the Americans explain that the Stamp Act and Parliament's other end-arounds to subvert the colonial legislatures' tax authority, were unconstitutional under British law as they interpreted it:\n\n> 8th. That the late act of parliament entitled, *An act for granting and applying certain stamp duties, and other duties in the British colonies and plantations in America, &c.*, by imposing taxes on the inhabitants of these colonies, and the said act, and several other acts, by extending the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty beyond its ancient limits, have a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists.\n\nAs for seats in Parliament, the Americans seriously discussed this twice - first, at the Albany Congress of 1754, which produced the [Albany Plan of Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Plan), and second, during the First Continental Congress in 1774 when pro-royal delegate Joseph Galloway proposed the [Galloway Plan of Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galloway%27s_Plan_of_Union). Under both plans, the Americans would form a council elected by the colonial legislatures, while this council would have a presiding officer appointed by the crown. This council would essentially be the American Parliament, co-equal to British Parliament, and would have (among other things) veto power over taxation that British Parliament's laws would impose upon the American colonists.\n\nBoth plans were rejected by the Americans, which probably didn't make much difference since Parliament and the crown would never have agreed to them anyway.\n\nNonetheless, it shows the type of \"representation\" that the Americans were looking for: they believed they *already* had representation on taxation issues, and that that representation was, by constitutional right, local. If Parliament wanted to assert that they were the ultimate authority on taxation, the Americans did have various counter-proposals, but they all still were based upon the claimed right that only American representatives elected/appointed by fellow Americans could tax them.",

The Whites weren’t a single unified movement, but a loose hodgepodge of groups that didn’t like the Bolsheviks. It’s even possible that once the Red Army was dealt with there’d be a second phase as of the Russia Civil War as different White factions started fighting each other. \n\nThere’d be huge differences depending on who wins, ranging from more moderate generals like Wrangel to hardened conservatives like Kolchak, or the extremists like Kornov and Sternberg. Big difference between Wrangel’s opposition to war crimes and support of non-Russian independence and Kornilov’s “I will 3/4 of all Russians if that’s what it takes to win.”\n\nNot to mention factions like the SRs, who were Socialists who just didn’t like the Bolshevik way of doing things.",

Both Sledge and Leckie were veterans of the Pacific War & those books were accounts of theeir experiences. I'm not certain which book was used as the source for the bits covering John Basilone, but they were accurate as well. Ironically the biggest change to Basilone's story was actually toning it down compared to what he really did to earn the Medal of Honor, because his real heroics were so over the top that they'd be less believable on screen.\n\nMuch as I love Band of Brothers, in terms of sheer accuracy the Pacific is much better. BoB is fairly accurate but Stephen Ambrose fell in love with his subjects and that resulted in a somewhat romanticized tone that carried over into the film adaptation. In contrast The Pacific's source material were books penned by actual veterans, so their portrayal of the war is much more dark and honest. That also carried over into the film adaptation.\n\nBand of Brothers has a better narrative in that you follow one company through it's an entire experience with the war, whereas the Pacific jumps between all three regiments of the 1st Marine Division and later follows Basilone to the 5th Marine Division and Iwo Jima, but of the two The Pacific was the more realistic portrayal of the war.",

What is historical accuracy?\n\nIs it more important to get the details rights (like the clothing styles down to the trims?). Is it more important to get the 'story' right (not to much time skips / all the details right etc). Or is it give a good impression of a certain age/period/story from history. For me personally, the last one is the most important one. But I know lots of people can blow a fuse about any movie detail that is off.\n\nAlexander was hated by some because of o.a. Collin Farrel and Jolie being not typical Macedonian. But for me, that movie had one of the best battle reenactments in Galgama AND one of the best 'wish you could see it moment in all of history' of the Greeks marching into Persopolis.\n\nGladiator, stupid movie historically speaking, but really captures how weird it must have been for a person to be sent out into the arena where 50k people are watching you fight to the death. Can you image the feeling if you step into such an arena?\n\nEven films like Apocalypso, although it mixed up Aztec and Maya completely and is absurdly wrong. But has one of the best depictions / impressions of the workings of a functioning, non western society in all of movie history. Which is damn much harder to do in a movie than depiction a battle completely correctly.",

                    "body": "The movie Gettysburg is entertaining but because it was an adaptation of a work of fiction it has some serious problems as far as historical accuracy goes.\n\nA big one is that highly overrates the impact of Joshua Chamberlain and the stand of the 20th Maine on Little Round Top. It wasn't even the most siginificant action fought on the Second Day at Gettysburg, and Little Round Top was not the most vital piece of ground. A far more important fight, on far more important ground, was happening on the other end of the field on Culp's Hill. And the defenders on Culp's Hill initially faced longer odds than the 20th Maine, and during the fight for Culp's Hill also had a bayonet charge of their own.\n\nHad the Confederates taken Little Round Top they wouldn't have been able to hold it, as they surely would have still taken heavily casualties in doing it, would have been absolutely exhausted as they were already in that state being launching their assaults, and the Union had plenty of fresh reinforcements in the area that could be committed to a counterattack. The rebels meanwhile, would have had to rely on the same exhausted, depleted troops. \n\nIn contrast over on Culp's Hill there was nothing but Greene's brigade, as the Union had shifted forces to the other side of the field to deal with pressure there. And had the Confederates seized it, they would have cut the Baltimore Pike which was the Union supply line. It would have been game, set, and match and the Army of the Potomac would have been compelled to retreat.\n\nChamberlain was great at self-promotion however and survived to write a memoir, while David Ireland, the man who led the charge over on Culp's Hill was killed in action in a subsequent campaign. George Sears Greene, the general that led the successful defense of Culp's Hill, also never penned a memoir. That and the cultural impact of The Killer Angels, the book the movie Gettysburg was based on, had led to Little Round Top's importance being greatly exaggerated while the far more vital fight over on Culp's Hill has been forgotten.\n\nGeorge Gordon Meade, the man who successfully presided over the Union victory at Gettysburg, is also bizarrely nearly absent from the film. He gets the briefest of cameos, despite being the figure most responsible for the Union victory and one who consistently outgeneraled Lee during the course of the battle.\n\nGettysburg is also polluted by some Lost Causeisms, with blame being shifted away from Lee and to Stuart for example despite Stuart being out following orders Lee gave him. The argument where Lee dresses him down is mostly pure fantasy.",

Because of course their engineers spent a lot of time thinking about contingency plans. But “we have five hours to figure this out before they die” is a lot more dramatic than “turn to page 543 of the emergency procedures manual.”",

It's not an accident that it happens a lot in Germany which is religiously disputed territory\n\n  \nAs for the example of Torquemada et al, that's got different motives. The Spanish Inquisition is there to solve a real \"problem\" of incompletely assimilated Jews and Muslims openly professing Christianity but practicing their real faith in private.\n\n\n\nThis has two consequences of note:\n\n\n\n1) The Spanish don't need to invent bogeymen or an enemy within - they've already got some\n\n  \n2) Because the Inquisition are professionals adept at ferreting out people carrying out secret religious rites and also strictly orthodox they know accusations of witchcraft are mostly BS, if not heretical and are going to tell you to get lost.\n\nWhereas in Northern Europe and especially Germany the barrier to calling yourself a witch-hunter is low to non-existent and people go torches and pitchforks very easily.",

Knights Templars got the lion's share it seems. In both materialistic wealth as well as esoteric knowledge. Their wealth helped them gain influence. Eventually their dark arts activities were caught as satanic practice and European kings abolished them. But mainstream focus is on huge debts by European kings. \n\nSecond phase is Spanish reconquesta. Muslim and jews lived in muslim Spain. Christian takeover of Spain gained Europe access to all the knowledge, library and mysticism in there. \n\nThird phase is fall of Constantinople when Eastern roman empire fell. Their scholars, clergy brought many books, knowledge, practices that were of esoteric knowledge. \n\nItalian region took full advantage of all the knowledge, backed up by their coastal area, wealthy society. That's where renaissance took place. Western mainstream nerrative only focus on the scientific discovery, achievement, activities from renaissance. But many renaissance intellectuals were also interested in all those esoteric knowledge, practice. Some banking family of Italy even gave financial support, patronised for such research. \n\nThat's why the surge of witch burning around renaissance. Some maybe got caught doing shady things, others maybe victim of conspiracy/baseless accusations. But the witch burning tradition got off from this background.

                    "body": "You're right, it does seem to have originated a bit earlier, although the reformation absolutely did intensify things and it's not a coincidence that some of the most violent periods of witch hunting occurred around that time.\n\nBut basically, the medieval view of demons and witchcraft was very different from the way modern Christians tend to view these topics. If you want an example, Dante's Inferno is a pretty good one. As far as medieval people were concerned, Satan and demons were cosmic losers. They had been utterly defeated and were helpless before the power of God. Worshipping or making deals with demons was seen as extremely pointless. They had very little real power to offer beyond deception.\n\nPeople were sometimes accused of worshipping demons but doing so was seen as foolish rather than actually dangerous. Again, demons can only trick people into thinking they have power.\n\nThe catalyst for changing beliefs about witchcraft was Catharism. The Cathars were a gnostic sect that seems to have spread very fast across southern Europe, and particularly what is now southern France between the 12th and 14th centuries (although there is some debate about how prevelant they actually were). Regardless, they were one of the first heretical movements that was seen to pose a serious challenge to the authority of the Catholic church.\n\nThis created a huge theological problem. Catholics believed that God was on their side and that God was omnipotent and could never fail, and thus it was very hard to rationalize why so many people had abandoned the church's teachings. Around this time, we start to see Satan and demons come to be viewed as more active figures who are still working to undermine Gods plan (even though they are still doomed to fail). Catharism becomes understood as a kind of anti-Church who are being secretly guided and manipulated by evil forces to destroy true Christianity. The idea of making deals with or worshipping demons becomes far more threatening because they are now understood to have real power and an actual agenda beyond just sitting in hell and moping.\n\nUltimately, Catharism would lead to the founding of the Papal Inquisition and a (pretty genocidal) crusade in Southern France, which seems to have wiped out or suppressed the heresy. But that idea that Satan is an active force within the world persists afterwards all the way to the present day.",

(Though I’d argue 2016 is the beginning of a seechange in American politics that we are still going through)\n\nIf one goes further back, Jackson is another figure with immense popular support whose politics still have relevance today. Reddit will harp on his pretty standard, for the time, racism but he expanded the power of the presidency and sufferage quite a bit in his day. \n\nYou’ve also got Teddy Roosevelt with whom a notable portion of the population still feels is the epitome of what being an American means.\n\nMadison and Jefferson sired over the country as it was being ironed out in its early years, both with effects felt to this day. ",

Nixon right now is kind of the endpoint imo for Presidents we can make decently objective analyses about, which is fitting for what a wildly mixed bag Nixon is.",

From my perspective, which you can agree or disagree with, it's especially bad as a president's actions should be compared to the standard of their time - for example Woodrow Wilson sponsoring the KKK is not exactly \"worse\" than Jefferson owning slaves, but at their respective time periods, one was highly normalized and the other was radical. Both are obviously terrible and they should be criticized, but Wilson, like FDR, should be, from my point of view, criticized all the more because their actions were outrageous even at the time. \n\nFor my pick, I would have James Polk, or Theodore Roosevelt. \n\nJames Polk for being an absolute workhorse and keeping all of his promises - He expanded American territory by annexing Texas, leading the US through the Mexican-American War, and acquiring some of the Oregon territory through negotiation with the British. \n\nTheodore Roosevelt for National Parks, Trust-Busting, Food safety regulations, not to mention winning a Nobel.",

And his racism wasn't \"standard\". It was more common then, but calling his version \"standard\" is misleading.\n\nJackson *hated* the Native Americans. He despised them, and his personal actions demonstrate this. On one occasion, after massacring 800 Creek tribespeople, he oversaw an operation where his men tanned the bodies and made bridles of their skin. Well before he was ever president he had a bloodlust for wiping out the native populations west of the Mississippi.\n\nMost white Americans would have been outrage and disgusted had they ever heard of it. Not exactly \"standard\" racism. No, Old Hickory's racism and quasi-genocide wasn't standard, it was quite advanced for its time. \n\n2) Jefferson wasn't just helping to \"iron out\" the country, he literally doubled the size of it and made great plans to settle and discover it. It was up to those who came after to iron that out which some did well while others did poorly (see point number one).",

I think Washington received the message before he was even President when controversy erupted because he was part of private clubs with politicians and people feared they were influencing Washington. He was never anywhere close to being King and there was no real path towards it. I guess he could've worked towards it but i don't think deciding not to is some huge move it was logical and IMO he gets overcredited.",

And so Fly might have taken two or more photographs of a specific scene a short time apart in order to get one with the best composition.\n\nI remember noticing during the previous millennium that books about the Apache wars seemed to depict two almost identical but different photos of one scene at the conference.  That was the scene with many participants seated on the ground or standing behind them in a U shape with the open end toward the camera.\n\nGeneral George Crook is seen almost on the right edge from the viewer's point of view. wearing a pith helmet. And to the right of the general is a small looking person.  He is the future General Charles D. Roberts  (1873-1966), not yet 13 years old.  And some people might wonder why his father and the General let him come to the peace conference, and other people might ask \"what could possibly go wrong at a peace conference?\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward\\_Canby#Final\\_assignment\\_and\\_death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Canby#Final_assignment_and_death)\n\nAnyway, I remember the versions of that scene in photos in 20th century books were different in two ways.  I noticed that Geronimo's pose is different in the two versions.  And looking at some online images on Nov. 15, 2024, I noticed that in some Geronimo faces almost directly toward the camera and his arms are almost symmetrical, while in others Geronimo seems to be turned slightly to his left (the viewer's right) and his arms slant down in that direction.\n\nAnd I also remember from the 20th century that in some images of the scene Charlie Roberts' face is expressionless, while in others he seemed to have a goofy expression, like he was talking, laughing, or coughing while the picture was taken.  All images I saw online on Nov. 15 show him without any expression, just a straight line mouth.\n\nBut if my memory of seeing versions of the scene in 20th century books is correct, most of them showed Charlie with a strange expression on his face.  And so, for the next 80 years, whenever he saw an image of one of the most important events from his childhood, the image would probably show a goofy expression on his face.\n\nSo fear of something like that happening might be why people in 19th century photographs tried to be expressionless.  They feared if they changed their expressions during the exposure their faces would be blurred, and they feared that if they tried to show a specific expression, it might turn out looking weird and goofy, and then they might be seen that way for decades and centuries to come.",

It may have been a factor pre-1860s but for later decades it's more likely people didn't smile because in the 19th century, photography was mostly still a formal thing done by professionals and people had been not smiling in paintings for centuries. It wasn't until the turn of the century that \"point and shoot\" cameras became more affordable to the masses and the birth of the candid photo or \"snapshot\" happened and therefore smiles became more common. You'd still see serious faces in professional photos in the early 20th century, generally the smiles are only found in home photos, which supports the idea that it was just seen as more formal.",
