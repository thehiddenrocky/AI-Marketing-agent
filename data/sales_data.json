I’ve helped and am currently helping several individuals break into tech sales roles that they otherwise wouldn’t go after. My process can be applied to non-tech roles as well. It works and I don’t charge until you’re getting interviews. I’m a top Enterprise AE and want to help others get their ideal role and cash bigger checks. Reach out if you’d like more details.",

Here’s my situation:\n\n\t•\tCurrent Role: Inbound-led, with no pressure to do outbound.\n\t•\tTargets: Inbound flow only allows me to hit the target 1/3 or even 1/4 of the time.\n\t•\tCompensation: Low salary with limited earning potential.\n\t•\tTraining/Development: No training opportunities provided.\n\t•\tCommute: Long travel times.\n\nOn the other hand, I might have a chance to join Datadog as an AE. Here’s what I know so far:\n\n\t•\tBase Salary: Twice as much as my current role.\n\t•\tInbound/Outbound: No inbound flow—fully outbound, and I’m uncertain about my ability to succeed in outbound sales.\n\t•\tTraining: Existing. I’ve heard mixed opinions, but it exists.\n\t•\tCommute: 3x a week office presence, but with minimal travel time.\n\nI need to make a decision soon.\n\nWhat would you consider when making the decision? What would you advise?\n\nEDIT: The new role would be to a developing market, which adds to the difficulty. ",

Great logo for your resume, great product that customers love, and great foundational sales training, but 5-10 percent of reps hit quota and I didn’t get a single inbound or SDR lead in my year as an AE there. However, now I work in a primarily inbound SMB AE role and am the top performer in outbound pipe gen which leadership loves, so Datadog definitely gave me a really good foundation to be successful with outbound.

ARR on deals are usually 50K+ for 24-48 months, and deal cycles can be 6-12 months for context. \n\nWondering how people are consistently moving initial meetings (SQLs) they have to second meetings (SALs). A lot of the prospects I meet with are telling me that they will have to debrief internally and see if there is interest (these prospects usually end up just ghosting me). This is something I consistently face, and a lot of the time the prospect may be a Director, but need to bring in their Medical Director and they won’t internally sell the value so they come back and say they are moving in a different direction. \n\nWould love to hear how others are overcoming this and any advice would be appreciated.

We do this through our wide range of marketing platforms that we can customize and tailor in a strategic way to bring the right customer in your door.\n\r\nPAUSE.\n\nIf it would be helpful, what we could do since it would be a bit easier on you guys, I could pull up my calendar here, and see what times I could stop by in between meetings in the next day or two and\r\nhave a more in-depth discussion for 30 minutes tops. I’m free Monday at 2pm.",

I am struggling with engagement, and when I asked for help, I was told to figure it out on my own as it will have more value and that my approach is wrong. I asked for sales training, and the manufacturer said they don't get involved with sales structure (we are distro). I realized they don't know how to sell it either...\n\nJust resigned there and moving into firm that says training on product AND sales process (yay!) is close to 6 months, and they give a year-long guarantee to ensure proper ramp up. That sounds much more effective.  Most people there have been there more than 10 years - good sign!",

Most people who come in have very little knowledge or experience in aerospace/aviation and even if they do, it’s a different way of selling. \n\nIt’s also very unique that the platform we offer is essentially three services in one which are of completely different value. It’s also unique in that our competitor and us *both* have a close to 60% market share technically because it’s common practice to use both concurrently for different reasons. So, the conversations are more of a “why you should carry both and how you’d utilize ours” rather than us vs. them. \n\nFor me, this came down to implementing a very tactical ongoing coaching structure that balanced their time and growth where they’re meeting twice a week for 30 mins and hosting product sessions. I had to be very meticulous about who I hired, who they coach, and kind of pairing reps with coaches who compliment their sales style and give them every resource and tool under the sun. \n\nIt was a challenge to make it work, but shits working thus far. Even long time lone wolf vets are growing because they’ve got the right person in place and there’s tangible impacts when we place focus in certain areas.",

That said, it’s only a helpful start, and isn’t going to make you a great salesman just by going through training. But if you do have the potential to be a good salesman it can definitely help. Still, unless they literally hire you right out of college and throw you in a boiler room to sort through who sinks and who swims, I don’t think most who fail can reasonably point to a lack of training programs as a chief reason. \n\nOf course, sales strategy in your market, ability to deliver/product quality, reputation, etc are all also huge variables not everybody has. ",

It’s 50/50 split for Sales and either 70/30 or 80/20 for other roles, which are less risky. The higher end belongs to the top performers and usually those are the ones usually holding the top tier enterprise accounts or “strategic” accounts/segment. \n\nTo answer your question, the folks I know make the base no matter what but they won’t last if they don’t hit their quota. Usually, once you’re ramped if you miss your quota for 2-3 quarters straight then you’re fired. I hate to say this but it’s how good companies are managed because I’ve been in companies where reps consistently don’t hit their quota for year or more and nothing happens. So if you’re good then you atleast make your OTE and assuming you miss you goals for one or two quarters it doesn’t mean you’re making $0 commission you’d still make at least half if you’re good. \n\nAnd you were probably wondering if people were making million of dollars and the answer is yes but they’re like one out of thousands and majority make less than $500K. Plenty of people I know made $400-$500K in 2022 then that dropped to $200-$300K last year. \n\nYour earnings also depend on the company you’re in as well as the industry. Reps in AI/ML are making a killing and so are the ones at certain high growth startups. I know a rep at my company who made over a million dollars and he’s in Mid-market but that rarely happens elsewhere.",

If the product has excellent product-market fit and has good demand, your sales will be easier. For any industry, check the below points, before taking a decision\n\n1. How big is the market and does the product solve an actual problem?  \n2. How is the competition?  \n3. What is the average sales closing time? The product I sell takes atleast 3-6 months which is a long lead cycle.  \n4. What is the average ticket size?\n\nSales is a tough job but it is extremely rewarding. Good luck to you and keep us posted on your journey",

            "selftext": "I work for a Solar Company as an appointment setter.\nFirst, when I onboarded, I was promised I'd be payed the Friday after site survey passed.\nThat day came, and I was then told that they changed their policy (without telling us) and they would pay me two Fridays after installation. That day is today, and they called my manager and told him to tell me I'd be payed when the panels are turned on. I recorded the phone call when I was promised to be paid today. (All parties to the call live in single party consent states.) \n\nWhen I told them this is not legal and that I was considering legal, I was threatened to be buried and that they would sue me for every cent I had. (Over text) \n\nIs there anything I can do?",

Fields like construction will sue but will do absolute back flips to avoid it because its going to be expensive for them as it is for you and I highly highly doubt they'd withhold pay to a meeting setter on a sold install for any reason outside of they don't have the money. \n\nIf its less then 10k my guess is they just pay you after they get a letter from an attorney. If its more then you may wind up in court but either way an attorney is who you need to be speaking with.",

If they think you’re a fit, and the $$ doesn’t align, they’ll either figure out how to, or keep you in mind for when it does.  If the pay and benefits are competitive, the recruiter is often seeking the happily employed, top performer as their top recommendation.  They are fully aware that it’s a challenging task, and it only takes one person to fill the spot.

I see a lot of public student directories that will at least give names and maybe 70% of the time student emails, but it varies. Phone numbers are hard to come by. I'm assuming there's some sort of ZoomInfo equivalent for collecting academic contacts, for people who sell educational products or recruit from academia. What's the best option here? ",

So I get it.\n\nBut at some point I had to draw the line into how much time, effort, money and energy I invest into conformity.  I choose to exercise and eat lots of healthy foods because I value my body and the experience it carries me through, despite appearances and how it stacks up to the ads/media. \n\nSo if doing makeup all the time is a similar overextension of your resources, then I say don’t even worry about it. Just focus on the things that energize you and make you feel good, and fuck what anyone else has to say about it. 🤘🏻",

I’ve been running my own startups since the mid-2000s, focusing on selling IT services and SaaS solutions to mid-market and large enterprises. Recently, I decided to exit my latest venture, which, admittedly, isn’t ending with the most glorious returns. I’m looking at a potential shift to working for an employer, likely at an OEM, VAR, or Systems Integrator in a Sr. Account Executive role.\n\nThroughout my years as an entrepreneur, my primary responsibilities were business development, marketing, and sales—my business partner handled operations. My entrepreneurship experience has given me a customer-centric approach, allowing me to effectively engage with clients at every level of their organization, from executives to technical teams.\n\nMy main question for the group is: Since I've been responsible for so much more than sales and have only worked for myself for over 15 years, will this be considered a disadvantage? Or do you think companies will value the breadth of experience from wearing multiple hats and being solely responsible for bringing in business?\n\nI would love to hear any insights or advice from those in similar situations or have thoughts on how companies might view this background. Thank you!",

It is harder to pick up certain cues and even face to face some people just aren't as good at communicating as others.\n\n  \nA good buddy of mine was an IT guy for a large insurance company(one of 5). Everyone loved working with him because he could communicate with people where others either made them feel stupid(think about the character from SNL back in the day...i think Rob Schnieder played him)...some people aren't built the same way you or I might be.\n\n  \nand we just have to be aware of it and communicate in ways that won't cause problems. Don't look at it like talking to them as if they are 10. One thing sales people take for granted is that we are more comfortable and able to communicate with people than others",

He likely doesn’t care about your reasoning or emotions or equivocation; “Hey John, please rewrite the ABC Co. contract with terms X, Y, and Z.” \n\nIf what you need is his opinion, tell him exactly that. “We’re trying to improve the ordering process for widgets. You have the most experience ordering widgets. If you could change anything you wanted, how would you design the process?”\n\nAnd then you have to not react emotionally to a logical response, even if it sucks to hear. “If you gave me better information upfront, we could take a week off the process because I wouldn’t have to keep asking you the same questions” is actually saying “We should have a standard order form”, not  “I wish you’d get it right, dumbass”.",

It is applicable in other fields (e.g. if a property management firm wanted a service provider to pick up keys to sites from their regional offices, outside of the providers usual scope - think of an engineer needing access to the motors of passenger lifts 🛗 in tower blocks 🏢).\n- The second best response here is \"good points, but we can't do this because [unknown complication]\". Continuing the earlier example, the complication could be that the internal reference numbers would have to be manually maintained in SFDC rather than synced through from the Development team's ticketing tool. Hence the *\"here's my thinking but correct me if I'm wrong\"* vibe - not unlike cold outreach in that sense. \n- The intent in any case is not to come across as the know- it-all, invalidate someone's viewpoints and get blocked by resentment anyway. Again, not unlike cold outreach.",

Small startup that was growing and I had been one of the top performing reps three years running. There's been minor issues but my own pessimism let them be bigger issues than they needed to be regardless of me blasting through my number. \n\nI opted to leave in June for a more prominent company, looks good on the resume and I got a decent pay bump. In addition, I wasn't growing much and was comfortable. Man, was I mistaken... it has been almost 5 months of torture/homesickness since leaving. I left behind a great reputation, great manager, and a fun product to sell that I knew how to sell well.\n\nI can't go a day or night without dreaming/thinking about the mistake I made or going back. I am not sure if it is just me being in an uncomfortable spot, lack of close relationships/people that believe in me, the product, my desk lol, etc.? I am at a lost and it is affecting my mental state and ability to even function at work sometimes.\n\nI've heavily debated on going back but it wasn't the cleanest exit due to another colleague leaving with me at the same time. I've started to mend bridges and I have heard they would take me back but don't want to make a rash decision.\n\n  \nANYONE been in a similar spot? It's taken me to the point I'll shed a tear here and there about everything. Never knew I would be this emotional about a career move.",

I had worked my way around the kitchen and had been grinding my way to the top. I was only 24 at a 1 star restaurant, a feat very few accomplish. I had menu control, was plating amazing dishes and running the kitchen essentially. Idk what came over me but after 2 years I saw friends doing things I deemed bigger and better and I wanted to leave the nest and go off and start to make a name for myself. \n\nI left my kitchen and my mentor for a beautiful restaurant with an ace team of other Michelin star chefs…and it turned out to be bunk as fuck. The owner was an egomaniac French laundry alumni that gave up no freedom to the chef de cuisine. The team had drama and was feuding with each other constantly. We were running the same menu for a year straight with no changes. There was lots of shit talk and drama, drinking; a bunch of distractions essentially.

It’s seems like a very saturated market, there are tons of roofers in my area if I just search. I think you have to be good at dealing with insurance claims as well as most people want their insurance to pay for it and insurances don’t want to pay for it. Most job postings I see us using your own vehicle, 100% commissions, doesn’t usually mention vehicle stipend. That’s my hang up of using my own vehicle wear and tear. You might get paid a lot but have to factor in more vehicle maintenance that might offset some pay. Worse if you don’t close deals. Work is still intriguing but worried about the long haul. Would be curious to get feedback from others that have worked in the industry",

People need the work done. The problem is after you close the deal the company having the resourced needed to finish the job. I have a customer who is a roofing contractors(60% commercial 40% residential). They have maybe 30 employees and they do great work and are expensive but if you call them for an estimate they tell you someone will be there in 4 weeks and if they want to go ahead with it it might be 8 months or more(on residential)\n\n  \nmy point is make sure the company you'd work for sets proper expectations and does good work",

            "selftext": "Hey Everyone,\n\nThis is a long post, but I think it will be very helpful. Lately as I've had conversations with my network within tech sales, there are countless stories about how people will ask all the right questions in the interview, read glassdoor reviews, and start at a promising role, only to find out it's a complete disaster. I know from experience how bad it feels to get blindsided, but it also has given me very valuable lessons on how to vet companies after having worked for 6+ companies in the industry.\n\nMost people tell you to ask questions such as % of reps hitting quota, how territories are created, etc. This, along with looking for patterns in negative glassdoor reviews is still necessary, but often doesn't tell the full story. Management in sales has also has become increasingly skilled in having crafty answers to these standard interview questions that hide inconvenient truths (assuming they don't outright lie).\n\nHere are 3 unconventional ways to break through the noise and snuff out bad situations at new sales roles.\n\n**1) Rule of 10 Years (applicable to new business roles, not account management)**\n\nI read an article about a prominent VC investor who had a rule for investing referred to \"the rule of 10 years\". Essentially this rule states that for any major go to market initiative such as building a start up, launching a new team / product at a larger firm, etc. you have a 10 year horizon to succeed. Within that 10 years, you'll either largely max out the potential, or never achieve the original goal. This is due to product market fit.\n\nIf you look at all tech startups that hit unicorn status (100M+ ARR), almost every single one does so within 10 years. After that 100M in ARR, growth of net new logos slowed significantly for these companies as they either IPO'd or stalled in the late funding stages / got acquired.\n\n* My first AE job out of college told me the territory was unlimited greenfield and my vertical had year over year growth for 6+ years. I found out all that growth came from upsells, most of the vertical was already existing clients, and I was essentially chasing scraps.\n* Another job I had was a startup of around 15M ARR that sold me the dream after their series B (had been in business for 8 years). They claimed all reps hit quota the year before, which actually was true. However, I found out this was largely the result of the company doing heavy discounting in a last ditch effort to gain new customers to attract a better exit. They wound up getting acquired the next year and the place went to shit.  \n\nI could've avoided both these situations if I followed this rule. In hindsight, the most important thing to know when joining a start up or a specific vertical / team at a large org is their growth life cycle and their historical trendline for ARR. Any company that has been in business or sold to a specific vertical for 10 years+ likely has already won most of their best clients, and if they haven't its probably for product market fit reasons that won't bode well for any new sales rep that joins. At that point, it's much better to join these companies in an upsell / retention focused role.\n\n**2) Learn how to read public financials like an investment analyst. They tell you the story of a company's past present and future.**\n\nMany reps who join public companies focus too much on asking questions about their specific team they join, but with few exceptions, the way a company is run will significantly effect your role, even at larger orgs. All the information you need is in their financials on yahoo finance.  Beyond stock price over time, key trends to look out for are as follows. \n\n* Reported expenditures in sales/ marketing as a percentage of total gross profit . Firms that have large sales / marketing spend relative to gross profit indicates that they try to force inorganic growth by hiring tons of sales people and it doesn't work well for them. Look at the trend lines for clear indicators of increases in sales spend relative to historical growth.\n* General admin / operating expenses relative to gross profit. The worst run / most inefficient company I ever worked for was a public org that had general admin / operating expenses that were close to 25% of gross profit. Should ideally never exceed 10% for a tech company.\n* Quick Ratio: This metric is current liquid assets /current liabilities. This metric should ideally always be a ratio greater than 1. If a company has more current liabilities than liquid assets, this is a major sign that A) the company isn't well run and B) if the company doesn't meet short term growth targets, layoffs are more likely to happen due to needing extra cash to pay off debts.\n\n**3) For Startups, The Financing and Valuations Never Lie**\n\nWhen vetting start ups, ask about the history of these funding rounds beyond how much money they got. What was their revenue at the time of their raise? What revenue multiple did they raise at? What is their valuation they raised at?\n\nThe reason this is so important is because revenue multiples fluctuate overtime per industry, which is what happened with tech recently. In 2021, any tech company that raised major funding got absurd valuations around 30-40x revenue. Now, valuation multiples have come back down to around 5-10x. This means that if a firm raised a\\` series A at a 40x revenue multiple and they had 5M ARR at the time of fundraising, their valuation is 200M. At a valuation multiple of 5x revenue, they'd need to get to 40M ARR (an 8x increase from 5M) to grow into their valuation. In order to achieve this, you company needs to be a unicorn or have super aggressive sales goals.\n\nUnless you're lucky enough to join a unicorn at an early stage, your revenue goals will likely be unrealistic and the culture can often be very high pressured if you join one of these companies.\n\nTypically, start ups will raise new funding rounds every 2-3 years and each round should be significantly larger than the last. If it's been a few years since last fundraising and there aren't clear signs of another round, that's a red flag that the company doesn't have investor confidence. If a company raises a funding round that is smaller or barely larger than their previous one, that is also a red flag that growth is peaking.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt's something we're all guilty of, but the key lessons I've learned over my career thus far largely involves not mistaking the forest for the trees. As long as your management / coworkers aren't incredibly toxic, the most important thing is being positioned to succeed financially.\n\nProduct market fit, joining a company at the right time, and picking the right role within a company are far more important for long term success vs how many inbound leads you get, how experienced your manager happens to be, etc. Anyone can get lucky and get a good territory even in bad companies, but who wants to leave their career to chance?\n\nMy hope is that the information I provided  will help everyone in better picking their next roles or at the very least, better understanding how the industry works.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Most of my stops were short so it wasn’t unreasonable to hit 10-15 potential clients.  Now that I’ve established some key accounts, I visit them every time I’m in a particular area and I rotate out prospects in that area to continue connecting with more potential clientele.  \n\nI am part of the supply chain for B2C businesses.  So, I start prospecting businesses that have a bigger internet presence (do they have a full website, do they respond to reviews, do they have active social pages).  Those businesses typically take an active role in improving themselves, so my services are better received.  They’re also usually higher value clients.",

Interviews for sales are pretty useless, so if they use this process as an actual sales test then it could make sense.\n\nIf that’s the case, a good two way test would be make vey technically proficient cold calls. Demonstrate specific skills. Sales isn’t about weird flashy gestures or gift baskets (mostly), so a better skill to demonstrate would be having a very technically solid cold call with a little pitch and a classic “so does next Tuesday at 9:30 work for you for a first-round interview?” advancement. Demonstrate very solid technical skills.\n\nIf they’re looking for flash and just playing hard to get IMO they’re for the birds.

He started 30 years earlier, Sega, HP, Red Hat, IBM, etc. He was in a competitive RFP for Comerica Bank after identifying a big leak around 2002-2003. His data analysis technique was as unique as it was simple, but no one in the industry had thought to include two additional, seemingly irrelevant data points. When he requested such data, they said they'd have to share it with the other vendors to be fair. Knowing that the competition would figure out his winning strategy for all future deals, he concluded he had to withdraw his bid. When he called to tell them the news, he was walking around his company's basement that stored all the old hardware, including a PC so old that ran on tape, so even before 5.5 floppies. Over the past year, he had gotten to know the IT guy at Comerica well, so when he answered, instead of bowing out, he asked if the bank had a similar machine in storage, and they did. This is where Jim got clever. He requested his two data points and even some more worthless ones be sent to all vendors on a tape drive, citing fairness. He said his guy there couldn't stop laughing as he realized what Jim was doing. In the end, he won the deal. And the two tape drives were on his shelf all four years I worked for him. Enjoy retirement, Jim - still the best sales story I know. Albeit, your beer story is a close second.",

He ran a reference lab out of the garage which means customers would send him samples and pay for the analysis vs. buying their own instrument. \n\nHe taught his daughter how to operate the instruments when she was around 7-8 years old and would take her to head-to-head demos when she was on summer break. The opposition would usually be some inexperienced  rep who didn’t really know their own instruments and his daughter would just run laps around the competition as he sat back without saying a word.",

Rep told me she did the whole job briefing the client on features and they were a buyer.  \n\nWithin the first 5 minutes of the demo the prospect is becoming borderline hostile because they think our software is similar to all the others they've sat through demos.  It's the same category, however we're far superior.  She tells me 'Go fuck yourself all these are all the same, this is a waste of my time.\"\n\n\"Hey, let me show you this, real quick, and if it doesn't help, we'll call it here.\"\n\n2.5 hours later the contract is signed.

The SF rep got a license and operated as an insurance agent at the company for the better part of a year. He compiled a report including recommendations for improvement (naturally including unique SF functions). This report was sent to the C-Suite of the insurer and was so comprehensive and impressive that SF won the deal. The rep got paid out something like $10mil.",

I had been emailing back and forth with a potential client for days, but nothing seemed to stick. We just couldn’t lock down a meeting time.\n\nFrustrated and running out of time, I decided to do something a little unconventional: I picked up the phone.\n\nI dialed the number, heart racing just a bit because, let’s be honest, cold calling isn't something I do every day. But something clicked the moment the prospect answered. We immediately started talking. No waiting for email replies, no double-checking time zones. Just a straightforward conversation.\n\nWithin minutes, we agreed on a meeting time—on the spot. No more back-and-forth. It was refreshing to realize how much faster and more personal things can move with a simple phone call. We laughed about how we’d been dancing around emails for so long when the solution was right in front of us.\n\nThe lesson? In an age of automation, sometimes going back to basics is the most effective way to make progress. A simple phone call can cut through the noise and get results faster than you'd think.\n\nSo, the next time you're stuck in an email chain, pick up the phone. You might be surprised at how much quicker things get done.\n\n\\#Sales #Networking #BusinessGrowth #ColdCalling #Communication #OldSchoolMethods #KeepItSimple",

And they aren’t bad, i somewhat build rapport and offer free clients, i don’t get paid until they do but it doesn’t work. I have gotten no clients, and 1 call but it was a straight no. Maybe its my sales skills or my marketing ability, idk at this point.\n\nIf someone could give me some insight or some help that would be great.

I make considerably less money doing this and the job hunt is a total nightmare. I could go back to being an operator but my body is all sorts of messed up and I'd rather avoid the long hours and weekend work.\n\nWhere should I begin to look for work and what roles should I be looking at?

            "selftext": "I was a Sr. Sales Manager at an early stage startup and got laid off. It was rough, because I was the founding AE, and built up the entire sales process which enabled the company to more than double YoY ARR over the next 4 years.\n\nWell due to multiple bad decisions by our C-level (as well as them making very lofty promises to our investors), we missed 2 quarters in a row and got denied our Series A. This of course caused the company to lay people off. Myself along with 80% of my sales team and the entire Marketing department got the boot.\n\nI started applying to tons of open positions on Linkedin and got nothing, so a few people on here recommended I use any professional connections I made in my role, and I decided to do just that. I worked with the CRO at my current company on a few projects previously, so I messaged him on Linkedin and told him the situation. He immediately got me into a rapid-fire interview with 4 members of senior leadership the very next day and I had a job offer the day after that.\n\nThis company is also an earlyish stage startup. (They have a $120m Series B) However... they have an amazing product with EXCELLENT market fit, the product has extremely positive customer sentiment, they are already very profitable, and even in this market they are set to double YoY revenue growth. All signs point to this being an actual unicorn SaaS start up.\n\nWhen I got laid off, I was borderline depressed. But somehow, it ended up being the best thing to ever happen to me. Moral of the story, when looking for jobs don't be afraid to use your connections and DEFINITELY don't be afraid to tell people why you got laid off. I was in the mindset that it was viewed the same as actually being fired. It's not.",

Normally this would be devastating since we’re approaching the holidays, but after losing some pretty huge deals during the summer I saw this coming. I fortunately secured a relatively cush job back in August with a start date in December making 36% more, no quotas, draws, or bullshit. It was a fun ride, had multiple blow out years in a row, and this year was a stinker. What I don’t understand is why a company would even do PIPs. Employment in the US is at will. They can fire you for nothing. Someone (unethically) could sabotage a bunch of deals, poison the well, bring morale down etc. Totally don’t get it. In any case, I’m looking forward to happily coasting these next few weeks, ringing up parting dinners with clients, and not worrying about deals going through before year end. ",

We both sat through the exact same orientations this week. \nI was canned today after work. She said I was not a good fit for the role. - after she just told me I was “a phenomenal relationship builder in the markets” yesterday. \nAlso she said they thought I would hit the ground running in the new CRM but I hadn’t even finished training??? What?! I found out today by her (the boss) that we both make full commissions in every sale. I was thinking we would just alternate or half the commissions. This is a senior living environment (move ins are the sales) \nAnd now I’m suddenly gone after two weeks. Also important to note I achieved two move ins this week. I worked hard for those! And of course I will get NO commission.\nI feel they hired both of us almost at the same time to see who they would like better. Because- ya know - company revenue /budgets. iFEEL STUNNED AND SHOCKED",

They were always the most demanding, liked to swing their titles around and had a more unnecessary bad attitude. Of course there are always exceptions, but just an observation I’ve had. \n\nEspecially the loudest voices on LinkedIn shitting on salespeople are always execs under 50 employee companies.",

We we're early, and I sold the living shit out paid POCs/Betas, but the churn was intense. We had no talent, most the important work was farmed to India-based Jr. developers. He wouldn't hire experienced U.S. talent....\n\n-But he paid for sponsorships at gala events, 3 sports teams in CA, anything that made him look like a big fancy CEO and tech-empresario \n\n-Drove a Lime Green Lambo, wore LV/YSL/Gucci everything\n\n-Super sexist and pretty sure he was banging multiple secretaries over my 3 years there.

This means they’re willing and able to have real conversations, and aren’t so focused on price as to demean someone, they just want to get the right fit.\n\nNow scale that up to running a company. The more successful execs understand the real issues they’re trying to solve, and will have real conversations to accomplish that rather than beat someone over the head to sooth their own ego.\n\nThat’s my theory anyways.

You can get into some sales positions without any experience, although you’d start on the lower end. After some years you could be on 300k plus OTE (on target earnings). It usually comes with a base salary and has commission depending on how many sales you make. Every company is different. I guess other jobs paying this amount or more include consulting firm partners, plastic surgeons, dentists, doctors, influencers, musicians, actors, lawyers, finance bros, drug dealers, business owners, but most of these either involve luck, legal risk, years of of grinding, high capital, or certain qualifications.

Here's what I'd do\n\nPre-Meeting \n\n1. call / email him - tell him you're doing final prep for the meeting and ask him what specifically he'd need to hear / see to make a referral. he understands sales. \n\n  \n2. look up exactly who you'd sell to in his company. don't ask for names during the meeting. tell him \"we'd typically talk to X, Y, Z do they handle ABC? Who else should we talk to?\" to confirm \n\n3. Do the typical account research. Tell them why you want to speak those those people. Frame it in their POV. don't make it about you, make it about them. \n\n  \nMeeting:\n\n1. you're not selling to him. Keep it casual. \n\n2. Acknowledge this \\^ upfront. \"I appreciate you willing to help out with this meeting. Typically we speak with accounting departments as they usually are experiencing abc. My goal today is to not bore you with the details but give you a few notes of what accounting teams typically experience that makes them want to set up meetings. To make sure I'm not off base, were you expecting anything different?\"\n\n3 Keep slides to minimum if you need them. Typical issues other similar customers experience and how you help them. Again, frame it in their POV. It's about value, not features. I'd recommend 2-3 more broad pains / reasons accounting teams meet with you (ones that just about any accounting team would say \"yes we experience that\" to) then 1-2 targeted niche reasons that tie into your value prop. \n\n3. ask for the referral. suggest an email introduction with you cc'd so you can keep him accountable. Ask when he'll do this and then let him know you'll be patient and check in if you don't see anything 1-2 days after that day.",

I suspect this was due to my lack of experience.

Watched investors push for growth at all costs only to crush what made the company successful. And never made as much money as promised (doh).  \n\nIt works for SOME but it is high risk. I loved working at those companies though. I really wanted one of those to work long term but after 3 rounds of layoffs and a reduction in comp for everyone... I made a move to more established companies.  \n\nIF you can get in and make it happen- it can be a career accelerator. But for every 1 person that makes it - there has to be at least 20 who don't. And some people succeed even though they don't really have the talent. The waterfall of leads was just sooooo high they made money and got promoted before it leveled off. Happens.",

            "selftext": "Hey! Hoping to get some help here\nI’m between 2 companies after moving back to Florida in the roofing industry.\n\nCurrently training with\nCompany A\nOpened in Massachusetts\nRevamping Florida sales market after a slower couple years. The owner is a good guy and a generational roofer. Sales aren’t super strong but that’s why they want me. I could help develop the sales team and in my opinion advance quickly. Given leads mon - Fri (Saturday optional) \nProbably be the strongest sales person at the Florida office, but I don’t necessarily want that, want to be surrounded by people better than me \nPros - seemingly good work life balance \nEasy advancement and growth as long as the Florida sales stay good, which would come down to my performance and helping the company as well.\nGiven leads \nNice owner \nCons - training has not been too in depth so far \nSales team needs revamping so nothing is really solidified as far as direction goes, but a goal is there \nJust re vamping Florida sales so what if it doesn’t go super well and cut backs happen again? No reason to fully believe that but it’s happened before\n\nCompany B\nFamily recommended Florida only roofing company with only 5 star reviews on Google.\nI would essentially have a personal mentor to teach me every single detail about running a roofing business\nIncredibly passionate seeming people and a very solid seeming culture \nOwner that has made his money and wants to help others grow as well \nNo current marketing efforts because they are just thriving off referrals \nWould get some leads here and there as well as overflow leads from my “mentor” \nPros - super passionate, hungry, driven and morally sound company \nWill learn so much and be surrounded by seemingly great culture and people \nSeems like a very lucrative company as well \nCons - potentially less work life balance initially, but since more lucrative will allow for more comfort later \nIt will be harder it seems, but a pro and a con \nLess company given leads than option A\n\n*Edit* I also want to say I’m thankful to have 2 opportunities, and include my gut is saying option B, I feel bad for starting training w option A though. They are both good options, and I truly like the owner w option A but there’s just something about the opportunity w option B and the passion, and energy there ",

If I could coach up my younger self the first piece of advice is to not take it personally.  I struggled with this for a few months constantly asking myself, “why me?” And “what could I have done differently?”  The fact is this decision is made 95% of the time from a team in ops + finance + external partners to your conpany such as the board, equity firms, etc (depending on size of your company) looking at a spreadsheet, it’s not personal.\n\nI’m not sure where you are financially- other posts here I’d agree with on jumping back in. If you can whether the financial hit I would recommend taking at least a couple weeks off to simply reset the mind.  \n\nDid they extend a severance offer? If so, have you already signed?  HR typically says you have 24 hours to sign, legally this is not true and many times a path exists to negotiate more but few know this path exists.\n\nFor reference I was a seller for 16 years, moved into management for 3 and now am in a sales ops/marketing role.

I make a low 6 fig, car payed for by company, all the bells and whistles of a big company, I didn’t even update my resume last time. I live in a medium cost of living area. (Central Florida). Connect with everyone you worked with, you are young, my boss when I was your age was a sales manager, 15 years later I ran in to him and he was a VP at a $3bil company, and we had dinner, and he offered me a job making $150k, when my last job was $60k. Keep connecting, and don’t be sad, but in a way it’s ok to be sad, because it shows you care.\n\nGood luck! Sales is a journey for sure.",

Remember, though, that this doesn’t define you or your abilities—companies make cuts for all sorts of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with the performance or potential of the people impacted.\n\nYou're already taking the right steps by updating your resume and reaching out to recruiters. That alone shows resilience and focus, which are key in sales. In the meantime, try taking a day or two to decompress and reset. Use this time to reconnect with people in your network—reach out, grab coffee, mention you’re open to new opportunities. Sometimes the best roles come from people who already know what you're capable of.\n\nAlso, this might be a great chance to refine your pitch about yourself. Think about the achievements and skills you’re most proud of, and use that confidence to drive your conversations. If you frame this as a temporary setback, you’ll be back on your feet even stronger. You’ve got this, and a lot of us are rooting for you. 👊",

It will help clear your head.\n\nIf you have family living with you, maybe take them with you. If not, call your folks or those you love while walking.  Tell them how much you love them. Laugh about some old stories from the past that you guys long forgot about. These are the important things in life that sadly slip away as we age.  \n\nOnce your head is clear, organize your contact lists. Get on LinkedIn and cultivate that garden of contacts. You don't need to mention that you're on the bench yet (although for some, you definitely should).  Just give 'em a \"What's up\" or share a relevant article with them.

Here’s what I did.\n\n-upload resume on indeed/LinkedIn and easy apply to as many roles as you can. I applied to roles that I knew I wasn’t going to take but just wanted the interview practice. It also helps build confidence.\n\n-write down a list of ten companies you’d like to work for and apply to any and everything you think you can do…even if it’s a reach. I’ve been rejected from roles where I thought for sure I’d get an interview and got to final stages for roles I did not think I’d get an initial interview.\n\n-make sure to have a good reason why you are looking for a new role. Something that makes sense to the recruiter, but still says I have value. This is where “stretching the truth” has played in my favor at times.\n\n-have a pc of success that will impress anyone you talk to during the interview.\n\n-being more relaxed and real with the interview vs. professional/formal, really made a difference.\n\n-the goal is to keep interviewing even when you get to an offer so you have the momentum on your side and you have a steady flow of confidence knowing you have other things in the pipeline. This confidence will come across in interviews and play a huge advantage.\n\nI ended up taking a job I “easy applied” for on Indeed. 50% increase in base with the potential to triple my current income. I’m moving from metals to industrial textiles.",

Don’t JUST apply to tons of jobs. It’s likely hundreds of others did the same thing of just simply applying to the job posting. Take it multiple steps further by searching LinkedIn for who might be a sales leader at that company and write them a personal note about why you’re the hardest working person in the room and why they should give you a shot. Pay for LinkedIn career premium just for the extra inmails you get with it. \n\nLast thing: this isn’t the worst timing to get laid off. While some companies are still tightening their belts and downsizing, other companies are raising historic levels of investment dollars from VC which usually goes toward GTM roles like sales. The money is getting deployed, companies are starting to hire, and large enterprises are starting to invest in AI through the means of smaller AI solution companies that just received tons of money.",

Pre 2022 the standard was 2 weeks for every year, maybe a month for every year of service, I’ve heard first hand this is now a week for every year though it also varies by state.  You’re in sales- there is an opportunity to state your case for more. If you’ve performed well or have extenuating personal circumstances you may be able to negotiate a bit more.  There are legal services that charge anywhere from $300-800 to review your your severance and get their take.   Might seem like an unnecessary service but if it nets you an extra week or 2, it’s a win.\n\nDefinitely sign up for unemployment today as it can take a few weeks to actually start.  Receiving a severance does not impact your ability to file for unemployment. \n\nBest of luck!  Look at the bright side, at 25 you just gained a first hand story to drop in future interviews about overcoming professional adversity. It sucks now, but sometimes things happen for a reason- I had my best run as a rep at the stop after I was laid off. You’ll land at a better place no doubt!",

As an example - you likely were given a shit territory to start but you built it into an over performing territory within 1.5 years etc. Give SPECIFIC numbers and list your achievements. Achieved 123% of budget in my 2nd year on the job.\n\nEven if you're listing your industry charitable work - make sure you SELL it and list your achievements within those roles.\n\nIn the education section, don't just list your education.

As tempting as it is to fire back, taking the high road here is the smartest move—going through legal keeps you above reproach and ensures that any response is strategic and documented. \n\nIn the meantime, stay close to your client and reinforce trust. Highlight any recent wins, testimonials, or the longevity of your company to subtly counter the competitor’s claims without directly addressing their tactics. Clients respect a calm, confident response over heated reactions, and it’ll reflect well on both you and your company. Good luck, and let your results speak louder than their rumors.",

If no answer, leave a voicemail referencing the email and LinkedIn message.\n\n**Day 5: Follow-Up Email**\n- Subject line: “Quick Follow-Up” or “Thought This Might Be Useful”\n- Build on your first email, maybe with a case study or relevant stat that addresses a pain point.\n\n**Day 7: LinkedIn Message**\n- If they’ve accepted your connection, send a brief message: \"Hi [Name], thought I’d reach out here too—happy to connect!\" No pitch yet; just keeping top of mind.\n\n**Day 10: Value-Add Email**\n- Send an article, report, or insights relevant to their role/industry. Show you’re here to add value, not just sell.\n\n**Day 14: Cold Call #2**\n- Follow up on the initial email or message: “I wanted to quickly check in to see if you had any questions about [solution]—we’ve seen it help others in [their industry] do X, Y, Z.”\n\n**Day 15: Last-Call Email**\n- Subject line: “Closing the Loop” or “Any Interest in [Solution]?”\n- Direct and to the point: “I wanted to check if [solution] might still be relevant—if now isn’t the right time, no problem. Happy to keep in touch for the future.”\n\nThis approach keeps you persistent without being pushy and allows you to show your value along the way. The cadence is adaptable, so test and tweak depending on response rates!",

My MD-specialist and dental colleagues tell me that their \"sales process\" is very similar to get people to finish their care plans to have good outcomes (especially in oncology where it's life or death sometimes).\n\nCons  \nInsurance barely exists for us in lower level care so I've had to learn how to explain to people that the out of pocket is much higher than it was back 20 years ago when deductibles were $100 and copays were zero and they covered exercise, adjustment, exams, xrays, and therapies all on the same visit.  \nStill fighting 'the stigma' but it's leagues better than when I first got out of school.  \nMedical referrals still suck because everybody is addicted to pills by the time they get to me and they have zero concept of maintenance adjustments or health in general since the trained-covid-helplessness transition of 2020.  \nInflation has people choosing less care rather than corrective care and not finishing care results in incomplete recovery -->less than desired results-->lower referrals. (this is just more of a challenge than a con).\n\nBest of luck to you in your sales work.",

I was getting out when plasma was big and LCD was coming in. \n\nAnd more importantly for me, I’m glad I got out when I did because audio has become such a total shit-show. \n\nI loved the audio side far more than video. Dolby surround, THX etc was just beginning to evolve for the home, but 2 speaker audio was my jam.

Some companies may also want you to fill their excavators and other equipment right off the truck and will pay a premium to save time on labour.\n\nFuel sales is luxury spending and it’s super competitive.

So you’re only remembering 1 customer list and the only challenge is remembering which products they carry, which is where the XLS files come into play.\n\nIn my current role, it’s quite a bit different.  I visit my whole book of business every 4-6 weeks and there’s a lot of visits to non-customers.  The current company uses an internally produced CRM.  I won’t lie to you either, it’s a pretty shit CRM.  However, for what I need it for, contacts and notes from my last visit, it gets the job done.  The CRM is formatted for mobile, which is why it’s stripped down, but it makes note taking much easier.\n\nIt’s nothing too wacky, every rep is different and some are better at remaining informed than others.",

Plus, it preserves your professional reputation—it’s a small world, and you never know when these connections might circle back.\n\n\n\nThat said, if your new role requires an immediate start or if you’re in a hostile environment, exceptions can be made. But in your case, since you like your team and may want to keep doors open, giving notice is the smoother exit. It’s a small gesture that can pay off in the long run.

            "selftext": "Quick background, I recently left a large tech company after 5.5 years to a smaller startup. I very much like the job as the product is good and I’ve already built a very solid pipeline and am forecasting well over my Q4 goal. \n\nWhat is not so good is my manager loves to meet. We have a standing 45 minute 1-1, 1 hour forecasting session, 1 hour GTM strategy meeting per week. He also likes to be hands on with my deals so on top of sending him updates on deals outside of the scheduled meetings to talk about them (forecasting meeting) he will often put 30 minute calls on my calendar to go over certain upcoming meeting agenda/strategy. \n\nSo while I appreciate him being hands on and invested in my job as I am still relatively new it is not uncommon to spend 4-8 hours a week on internal meetings with him plus lots of slacking back and forth. \n\nHas anyone ever navigated a situation like this?My goal would be to reduce our internal meeting time by half but since I’m only 2.5 months in I’m not sure how it would be received if I asked to meet less. \n\n",

Customer meeting might be $5,000-$10,000/hr task to the company. \n\nInternal presentation reviews, pipeline reviews, quarterly business reviews and all sorts of other internal tasks have an expected value of zero. No matter how much you do them, it’s unlikely to move the needle on your quota.\n\nYou need a weekly plan of your tasks and their expected value better add up to your quota/# of weeks you work in a year. \n\nOnce you have that plan, show your boss that making 20% of your work week have an expected value of $0, is too much to get to your plan. Lowering to 10% is a good start. ",

                    "body": "Another approach could be to introduce more structured updates that cover everything your manager usually wants to discuss, freeing up time and subtly signaling that fewer meetings might still keep him in the loop. \n\nFirst, send a concise, high-level update on your pipeline, deal progress, and any strategic plans before the week starts. This could address most of the points he brings up in the 1:1s, forecasting, and GTM meetings.\n\nSecond, I'd suggest a *Biweekly Meeting Cadence*. After a few weeks of consistently sending these summaries, ask if he’d be open to a biweekly cadence for some meetings. Frame it as wanting more time to implement his guidance effectively.\n\nThen I'd Leverage Slack Updates. When it’s a quick update or question, communicate it on Slack instead of booking a call. Position Slack as a way to address small issues instantly and reduce the need for additional meetings.\n\nMaybe also you could end each meeting with a quick review. If he schedules an impromptu call, end it by summarizing your next steps and stating when you’ll update him, reinforcing that he doesn’t need to add more meetings to stay informed.\n\nThis way, you’re showing that you’re proactive, receptive to his involvement, and equally invested in efficiency. Over time, he may naturally start scaling back on the meetings.",

                    "body": "Your concerns are valid. I would wait until closer to the 6 month timeframe to broach this topic.  Unless your manager is a dreadful micromanager, they probably got burned with a poor hire previously and want to avoid that mistake again.  Couple ideas you can look at prior to discussing with your boss:\n\n1. If you have a team member you have good rapport with, ask them for their thoughts in an indirect and respectful manner, do it in a way where if the manager finds out they won’t be offended, such as “things are going great and feeling confident about how q4 is shaping up but I’m finding I’m having to work a lot of late night hours to find time with all the internal meeting demands.”  See how they respond, if they too struggle with this then you probably have a micromanager of a boss- if they don’t, then it’s probably more likely you’re just new and the boss is spending extra time to get you up to speed which is valid after only 2.5 months, imho\n\n2.  If you feel like you need to discuss with your manager sooner than 6 months, make sure it’s in a constructive manner and not complaining, such as : “I’d love to find more time in the day for prospecting and external activities, can we streamline our internal syncs to one 90 min meeting or can an email pre-read for our 1 on 1 save us an extra meeting”. Having been in sales for a while now, few to none sales leaders would push back on opening up more client facing time.  \n\n3. Protect your calendar more deliberately with recurring time blocks, title them “prospecting” or “call follow up”.  I swear, ever since Covid we just feel the need where everything has to be a meeting and there is no respect for others calendar and the need for focused busy work.  Vast majority of deal progression occurs during non meeting hours, I find that a common trait of most top sellers is they are judicious with their most valuable resource and that’s the time in the day\n\n4. As others have said, make sure you proactively keep them in the loop. As a former seller and sales leader, many reps don’t understand that managers are mostly doing this so they don’t look dumb to their director and Vp. Make your boss look good and don’t give them reason to need to pry and you’ll prolly find real quick a greater level of trust throw to you and less internal time wasted on basic internal requests",

This way you negate the chance of anyone thinking you're lazy or incompetent for failing to complete the task, and can walk through with your manager what you think are the bottlenecks in the process. If it's mutually agreed that at the current rate, this task is impossible, you can work out a new goal. Try to get them to emphasize with your current approach and see if either you have a gap in process and they can show you a better way or they mutually agree the goal posts are unrealistic and you can mutually work on framing a new goal. Try to buddy up with the manager and getting it to be you guys vs. the process opposed to you vs. your manager.",

Anyone know when traditional outside sales started to transition from a blue collar-ish job to the higher paying job that requires a college degree that it is today?  My dad was an old school territory sales reps, as were some of my neighbors when I was growing up.  We lived in a slightly nicer blue collar neighborhood.  Didn't get rich, but my dad would make the President's Club and get a free trip to a place like Vegas or Florida for a week with the other guys in his company.  This was the 1970's.  Nobody in his office had a college degree and there was a definite stigma to being in sales. \n\nI got into sales in the late 90's, my first company required college degrees and it we were getting paid comparable to some professional jobs.  Few guys in my office were doing 6 figures back then.  When did the change occur and why? ",

Yet she might not even have finished primary school, and her income potential is tiny. On the other hand, a farmer is a blue collar and might be quite wealthy.\n\nWhite and Blue Collar is differentiating TYPE of work. Not education nor income. There are plenty of Blue Collar workers who are millionaires, and plenty of White Collar workers who are barely surviving cheque to cheque. Education also is not a part of it. \n\nLets take your factory as an example. A White Collar designs cars, working in an office. A Blue Collar builds them, working on the floor, with machines.\n\nThese terms came to be because in old days White Collar workers actually wore white collared shirts, or dresses, as it was \"clean\" work, while the Blue Collar jobs required you to wear Blue, or at least dark colored clothing, as you'd likely get dirty, from grease or whatnot.",

I am coming from SaaS but the sales manager is a family friend and says this could be an excellent opportunity not only to make money but also to be groomed for sales management as none of the current reps are interested in advancing their career.\n\nI am not afraid of the grind and putting in the work but I don’t believe there is any true training program, marketing or referral networks established. The current reps are all seasoned and sitting on books of business so they are trying to bring in some fresh blood to  hit the ground and bring in new business. \n\nIt does not seem like they have a specific niche that they dominate but they are willing to invest in equipment as they work with primarily household names as clients (large volume). They are ISO certified but it does not appear food safe (no hair nets during the tour or anything like that).\n\nWhich leads my to my question. Where on earth do you start to prospecting for packaging sales? Is it just googling companies and hammering phone calls for procurement directors to make connections? Who would be a valuable referral partnership? \n\nAny insight on packaging sales and strategy would be greatly appreciated! ",

Now it has to be super custom with a box, an insert or two.  We contract with a few consumer brands to fold the boxes and insert the finished goods.  Our labor is probably equal to the cost of the box.  Which our rep gets a piece of.

Unless you or your company wants to share proprietary revenue data with an outside party, its not like they can reasonably validate it. I have had some ask for my W2, but really I think asking for ANY of this is a red flag, especially a personal tax doc. Probably not a company I want to work for.\n\nThe real issue with stretching numbers is keeping the story straight. It's so easy to slip or have an inconsistency, like telling them you close x deals at an average of y dollars, but your quota is z and the percentage isn't in line with any of those numbers. \n\nI remember bombing one because when I told the interviewer average closed deals per month it wasn't the same thing I put on the initial application that I had long since forgotten about entirely. It wasn't even a giant stretch either! I think I'd just been on a bit of a roll when I applied vs when I interviewed so my estimations were off by like 1-2 deals per month, but that little discrepancy completely sucked the air out of the call.\n\nTypically just being truthful and having a good explanation is the better path.

What if at company 1 you can reasonably sell $500,000 but at company 2 are working with bigger deals and you can do 5,000,000. Which one would you prefer? 50% of 500k or 25% of 5mil?",

Working on a sales floor can be beneficial, but if you're at a smaller org and there are only 2 AEs and 1-3 SDRs, you're probably not getting that much out of the sales floor environment to be honest. \n\nMy last job involved zero \"cold calling\" and no prospecting. I was an AE at a fintech and all my accounts were free trialers or SDR opps, it was far less enjoyable than doing my own prospecting. The connect rate was lower than the jobs I had before that involved cold calling, and of the ones who did answer, 75% were not even actual businesses. It was extremely frustrating. 100 dials and 3 answers, two of whom were college students who signed up because their professor asked them to do so for a class project.",

Any advice given will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n**Who I Am**\n\nI have been a career salesman since 2018 at 2 different jobs. I was the assistant store manager at a telecom retail store where I finished as a top performer every single year. I have also been a territory sales rep in the craft beer space for 1 year. I am Canadian, 32 years old, no children, no house or anything else tying me down and I live in Victoria, BC (not far from Vancouver). I have a sociology degree.\n\n**What I Want**\n\n- Outside/territory sales.\n- minimum $55,000/year but I need room for growth. I'd like to be working towards six figures eventually.\n- Working face to face with people whenever possible.\n- Travel for work is a huge perk for me. I love being on the road. \n- If I could somehow move to the USA that would be a dream but to my knowledge that's simply not realistic.\n- I want responsibility. I prefer working solo but I have experience leading teams as well. Happy to take on high-responsibility roles in either setting, as long as I'm being stimulated and challenged on a regular basis. \n\n**What I Don't Want**\n\n- No cold calling. No door-to-door. Warm or hot leads only.\n- No sitting at a desk all day. I'm a closer. I shake hands and I close deals.\n- Anything that requires a specialized degree. So as far as I know selling pharma or medical tech is out of the question. (If it's not... please let me know how). \n- I'm not willing to go back to school for 4+ years. 2 years or less I would be willing to consider. \n- I don't want to be limited to Vancouver Island (where I live). Not only am I willing to travel for work but I'm willing to relocate as well if the right offer came along.\n- Boring or easy jobs where I phone it in the entire time.",

Victoria's AMAZING!  \n  \nGiven you’re all about face-to-face sales, responsibility, and travel, have you thought about jumping into business automation, maybe with an agency or even setting up your own? Stuff like GoHighLevel (GHL) or HubSpot is blowing up right now since every business wants to do more with less.\n\nWith your sales chops, you could easily pitch automation setups to mid-sized companies and just grow from there. As automation keeps expanding, there’s this natural move toward AI-powered tools, so you’d be right where the future’s heading in sales. Solid pay, huge growth potential. honestly, perfect for someone like you aiming for six figures. And the best part?   \n  \nNo cold-calling; maybe some marketing will be needed though (emails, sms, etc)\n\nDM if you need any deeper look or a starbucks chat somewhere in west end )))",

Even if they were able to filter out hallucinations it won’t be able to produce anything outside of its training data that is new. And no they have not gotten ai to reason. Apple released a whole paper about this a couple weeks ago. \n\nI do not trust the people who are working in ai to tell us whether ai is going to keep getting better. Tech is the biggest dog and pony scam of all time (besides maybe crypto). They always promise the moon and rarely deliver any actual products. Not to mention the cost of actually running these models at actual scale will take more power than the world currently produces. By a lot. Microsoft literally just purchased a nuclear power plant lol. Hardly seems feasible",

                    "body": "This sub has a lot of younger folks sucked into the hype of earning a 100k+ base and this leads to the delusion that they will hit OTE. Think about it. You’re like 26/27, you hit the jackpot at a big fat base salary selling (probably) software. You get to brag to your friends and family that you work in “tech.” It’s better than what you were making at the honda dealership, more dignified than selling insurance on 100% commission, and no dealing with the general public. The hiring manager makes you believe that OTE is attainable because you already got a sweet base. He couldn’t possibly be lying right? They’re investing so much in me! Then you realize that said (probably startup/early stage) software company just had to hire a bunch of warm bodies as part of some prospectus that was pitched and sold to a VC company for seed money. You get no leads, no training, and eventually get PIP’d because you weren’t able to peddle a product that’s expensive, doesn’t work, and that the market has no need for. The company actually had no intention of you succeeding. You were just a pawn of a fake business where the founder(s) needed money to pay off some other debts.\n\nI digress. The only people probably making OTE on here are the ones in “unsexy” industries like manufacturing or construction, and it took 10-15+ yrs to get there. So maybe like 10% ? People like to lie/brag on here. So maybe less",

First, I'm not pooping on your situation. 3 years is an insanely long time (perhaps indicative of a more significant problem). I get the desperation.  Sadly, desperation is a stinky cologne. When they smell it, they don't want you.  Asking smart questions shows an \"abundance mindset\" of a winner. It signals a \"you need me, I don't need you\" without the arrogance of actively portraying it.  \n\n\"If I am ever lucky enough to even get another interview...\"  That kind of language is likely a piece of your situation.  Un-ass that shit from your vocab.  Your head ain't right. 3 years on the bench will do that to a person, so I COMPLETELY get it. I'd probably be drinking EARLY in the morning after a year. But you need to get that confidence back. If you can afford therapy somehow, do it.  Every other high performer in professional athletics has someone helping them tune their head.  I guarantee that you aren't operating on a Tom Brady/Michael Schumacher level. So you aren't above it.  Until then, you're gonna have to find a way to fake it till you make it.  Get on YouTube, type in \"Zig Zigler\" or \"Jeffrey Gitomer\" and believe with all your heart. Again, if you're desperate, the nervous, needy energy will emanate like the stench of the motherfucking dead. \n\nRegarding smart questions, are you asking them like you're trying to get the plans for the rebel base with an interrogation droid behind you?  Or are you taking Peter Falk's Columbo approach.  Don't know who Columbo is? I'd recommend that any salesperson watch a season of Columbo before Glengarry Glenn Ross or any other \"sales\" movie.  Por exemplo, the first six questions should NEVER trigger defensiveness.  If so, you're asking them wrong. If I'm asking about the previous rep, I'll jokingly ask, \"So what happened to the last mayor of the territory? Did she get voted out  of city hall or decide make a run for governor?\" Say it with a smile and humor. This will almost always get a laugh and disarm.",

Most (technical) sales reps have been with the company for 20+ years, the reason they're hiring is that one of them is retiring after 30 years with the company. They're retiring in 12 months, but the company is hiring someone now to give a year of overlap. I'd be working a lot with them, but not shadowing them for an entire year.\n\nThe branch manager gave me the name of the person currently in the role and told me to \"do what you need to with that\". I was planning to reach out to them to introduce myself and get their thoughts on the company, maybe over coffee. Is this a bad idea, should I instead wait until I've accepted the offer or not do it at all?",

            "selftext": "VC money is about to start flowing. Probably not as much as 2020/21 but ALOT of money has been on the sidelines the past few years. \n\nMany reasons for this but mainly due to a lack of ability to provide returns to LP’s via IPO’s and/or acquisitions due to the market and regulatory environment. \n\nThis has changed. \n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nWell if you haven’t seen the recent news, Salesforce is hiring 1000 new reps (not exactly due to the same forces but shows a trend) and my LinkedIn inbox is getting flooded 3x more than it was a month ago. \n\nMany companies will take this VC money, plow it directly into the GTM team, then fire all those people 12-24 months later when growth isn’t meeting expectations. \n\nIf you need a job, are young, lack experience, etc. do you what you need to. \n\nBut if you can help it, watch out for:\n\n•companies under 10 years old\n\n•companies that don’t have SOLID product market fit\n\n•companies with new sales management\n\n•companies that just raised a round\n\n•companies that don’t have proven reps already \nmaking the kind of money you want to make\n\n•And my personal primary criteria, companies that are not #1 in their market  \n\nI’m confident you could argue for/against all of these but these are just what I personally feel is important.

After all, firing all the engineers today raises cashflow and won't affect the product for a couple of years and by then the PE firm wants to be out of the picture.\n* Eliminating GTM - Most PE backed companies aren't looking at expanding their share, in fact they tend to go the other direction and refocus on the install base because acquiring net-new logos is hard and costly. More on this in bullet five.\n* Offshoring support - Good support engineers are expensive, you can acquire so many more people in India for the same price! This enables you to meet the support obligations you signed up for without actually having to pay full freight.\n* Eliminating professional services - If the product has a service requirement for implementation, you can expect the internal product experts to be sold off to someone else. The reason is that the blended margin on the product + services is lower than just product.\n\nNow you'd think that eliminating support and services would piss customers off to no end, and it does ... but that doesn't matter because ...\n\n* Relentless price increases on the installed base - Most PE firms focus on squeezing the customers for all their worth. In fact, the technical term is \"Bombing the rubble.\"  And you can see why becaue the math works, tbh. Consider, if the firm raises prices by 4x, but only 50% of the customers quit (in that first year) - you're still making money! Of course, this is not a long-term strategy because 50% of the customers that stay will hate your guts and will work on ways to transition out of the firms products.\n\nNow, if you need a job - take the job. Just head in with your eyes open. Everyone you speak with will say the same thing to get you in the door—PE is investing, we're focused on growth, blah, blah, blah. The reality is that you're taking on the role of a hostage-taking pirate. You'll be asked to bear the full weight of those angry, hostile customers *while* being asked to pull from ransom out of that resistive base quarter after quarter.\n\nWhile this sounds \\*horrible\\* since you won't get a chance to work on your relationship-building and joint problem-solving skills. And let's face it, extortion is \\*not\\* that fun.  Working for a PE backed firm does help you develop skills around handling really angry people and be able to see the loopholes in MSAs, et al, that the PE firms use to justify breaches and nonperformance. Also, because not that many people appreciate piracy, there's always room opening up at the top (which means you might have some upwards mobility).  And, if you are a really, really excellent pirate - sometimes the PEs will move you into their other portfolio companies.",

Specifically, I deal with hedge funds, private equity and VC. On the surface, sure, markets are happy with a definitive election and a growing economy and there is a miniature spike here that feels like a relief given the market conditions for the last 2 years. I’m sure that’s why there are an increase in job listings for major corporations. \n\nDon’t let it distract that there is extreme concern (from pretty much the entire institutional investor community) about Trump’s inflationary policies and wanton disregard for the Fed (and anything regulating his, ahem, bodies). If the Fed decides not to cut rates in December, (an increasingly likely scenario) we could be in for another dark winter which will almost certainly bleed into a bearish spring/summer for small cap.\n\nAll that being said, there is an argument that Trump’s rhetoric is attributed to campaign talk and we could enter a golden era of growth. Even in this dream scenario, it’d still be hard (maybe even harder?) to decipher what’s real and what is bullshit. Regardless of all of this macro, just be useful and it will all work out great. \n\n-signed, a kid not right out of college",

Eg we'll bring in x clients a year, at an acquisition cost of x, our current net revenue retentionis x, meaning we will grow by x each year. If your comment were accurate, all a company would be able to show is large churn, a declining customer base and no new customers - no company in their right mind would invest or acquire a company like this!\n- Most PE firms are focused on increasing cashflows... mostly because they have a ~5 yr window to sell the firm off at a profit: This one doesn't even make sense. Cashflow and profit are 2 different things. Most businesses are valued on revenue or EBITDA multiples, cashflow doesn't generally come into it. Even Free Cash Flow, when used, is just a small angle companies might use to tweak a valuation already based on revenue/ebitda. Seed, Series A, Series B, and often Series C generally want companies burning through the cash they've raised to grow/innovate as quickly as possible, to maximise market share/be the first mover etc. These investors don't want a company being cashflow positive, trundling along at a nice 10% a year, they want quick investment of their cash now, to grow much quicker, to maximise the valuation at the next round/exit.",

It's a bit long, but you're in sales, you're clever enough to follow along.\n\nVenture capital funds are partnerships (i.e. LLPs). There are two kinds of partners: \n\n1. \"GP\" or general partners who make investments. \n2. \"LP\" or limited partners or investors, usual institutional—insurance companies, pension funds, endowments, fund-of-funds, and sovereign wealth funds (SWF)—that are looking to grow their assets\n\nFor the most part institutional investors manage their investments to meet future obligations—technically, it is something called \"asset-liability matching.\" Traditionally, institutional investors, especially pension funds and endowments, heavily used fixed-income instruments \\*because\\* they mature when the liabilities are due and the returns were somewhat guaranteed.\n\nThis model worked for a long time until it didn't. During the period of zero interest rate policy (2008-2015) and ultra-low rates (2015-2022), the yield on fixed income was not enough for institutions to meet their obligations.  \n\nThis hunger for yield is what drove much of the interest in alternative investments —hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, commodities, real estate—the thinking being that ex-fees, which are enormous, the return from these alternatives would make up for the yield from traditional high-quality government and corporate bonds. \n\nSo what we saw in the industry was an avalanche of money (largely stupid money) pouring into PE and VC.  And then you had chancers like Son/Softbank setting up 1B$ funds to invest in madness like short term office rentals. That drove even more money and interest into the industry magazines and magazines of \"dry powder\" (investable cash).\n\n  \nBut of course the pandemic, with all its global inflationary pressures, pushed up rates everywhere across the board. That led to a pull back on commitment and interest in alternatives. After all, if I can get \\~5% yields again in AAA or AA debt that's 100% liquid,  do I really need the illiquidity of PE/VC? Selling VC/PE stakes on the secondary market is a pain in the ass, less with secondary markets, but still not as simple as selling off your 10 year treasuries. \n\n Moreover, there has been quite a bit of anger at certain GPs from LPs because the returns that they thought they would receive have not materialized, and the cash commitments have not been deployed. \n\nThe thinking is that falling rates make VC investment interesting again and that will spur more private placement since the higher yields are more attractive than the \"regular stuff.\"",

I’m talking on your feet until you’ve gotten a full pitch and call back out. 100+ cold calls a day. Also, it is truly the only environment that lies like that still. “This delegate is coming!” When they aren’t, sort of thing. However if you thrive in that environment where you like partying and hammering the phones etc there’s nothing like it. Most conference sales places really try to replicate The Wolf of Wall Street from the partying to the lying. Money wise you can earn a pretty decent amount if you’re new to sales. I was 23 earning about 100k dollars if you convert what I was being paid in GBP. And that was 10 years ago. One positive I will say is that because you’re on the phones a lot you do get absolute vital training on phone tonality and cadence because the mindset is “you’re speaking to C level”.",

                    "body": "Ok first off, if you don't have extensive sales experience in what you're applying to / the role doesn't call for it, run from anything with 3 rounds or more. Most entry-level sales jobs really only need 3 things to guarantee you're good for that company: foundational sales skills, coachability + adaptability, and motivation irrespective of compensation (because they would prefer to make a crap offer 9/10 times and need you to remain motivated). The way to answer these is just like you do with a prospect, you solve them before they come up and you run away if talent acquisition keeps trying to hedge on \"specifically answer just the question.\" Your prospects don't want narrow \"succinct\" answers, they want a holistic one. And just like talent acquisition, most prospects never know what they truly want / need until they see the right solution in front of them.  \n  \nAnd #1 of all, don't listen to a single person from talent acquisition no matter what they say or what experience they make up. Questions like the ones you listed are simply hiring scorecards to justify their crappy hiring decisions when it quickly becomes apparent that they have no clue how to hire for a single role that isn't theirs (past what the HM tells them to filter for). HMs are even worse to take advice from as most of the skill-based filtering has already been done by that stage and all they're good at is determining fit.\n\nNow how to tackle interviews?  \nIf 1-round hiring, wing it and let your personality shine as they typically take gems in the rough over nuggets with dust. Preparation can typically kill your chances in single-round hiring for many reasons.  \nIf 2-round hiring, then you spam Talent Acquisition with skillset and experience (so that they can justify their post-filter choice to HM). And if your TA interviewer is trusted / not new, then on 2nd round interview you focus entirely on personality / fit with the HM.  \nIf 3-round+ hiring, then I suggest mastering the fetal position with a comfortable pillow, security blanket and a freshly washed thumb.",

That shit would change my life, I know it,  but you gotta play the whole game…I’d imagine many doctors will either not diagnose you, or prescribe you other shit first…strattera, etc. and they’d be very hesitant to prescribe stimulants. I made up this narrative in my mind.\n\nI would fucking love to try an adderall prescription, but it seems like…how can this be legitimately prescribed? It’s…too good. The DSM for ADHD is so vague and outdated. Who *wouldn’t* benefit from an adderall prescription? I mean…there’s some bad side effects and come down issues but, man.\nI just truly can’t believe I could be prescribed it. It helps me fucking complete *any* arbitrary task. It’s like magic. But I can’t say I’ve tried it to a doctor, otherwise I’m a “drug seeker”. I feel like a fraud. But I mean, I’ve never lived up to my potential and can barely get out of bed.",

                    "body": "I get why it might seem that way—stimulants *can* improve focus and energy for most people, but there's a fundamental difference when it comes to how they work for individuals with ADHD.\n\n**ADHD brains function differently.** What’s considered a “stimulant” for someone without ADHD has a unique effect on us. Instead of energizing or heightening activity, ADHD medications like Vyvanse bring calm, help us stay awake and alert, and crucially, allow us to *discern priorities*.\n\nFor someone without ADHD, taking stimulants might feel like a boost of energy or motivation. But for us, these medications do something much more profound: they give us a sense of order and relief. Without them, we experience an overwhelming mental chaos where everything—whether it’s brushing our teeth, closing a high-stakes sales deal, or remembering where our keys are—feels equally urgent and important. It’s not just about lacking motivation; it’s about lacking the mental structure needed to prioritize and execute tasks efficiently.\n\nBefore my diagnosis, I would break down daily trying to manage even simple responsibilities, because my brain couldn’t filter out what truly mattered. When I started taking Vyvanse, I finally had moments of clarity. Suddenly, I could complete tasks and feel a small sense of accomplishment—something I’d never experienced before. It wasn’t that I became more motivated in the traditional sense; rather, I became capable of prioritizing, which allowed me to function in ways I never could before.\n\n**Why This Matters**: Yes, stimulants can make *anyone* feel more focused or alert temporarily, but for those of us with ADHD, they provide life-changing neurological support. It’s like going from drowning in an endless to-do list—where nothing feels important or rewarding—to finally being able to breathe and tackle one task at a time, in order of genuine importance.\n\nNot everyone benefits from ADHD medications in the same way, and they’re not a simple “performance enhancer.” They address a specific dysfunction in the brain, enabling us to work and live in a world that demands structure and priority-setting—something that comes naturally to most people but has always been a monumental challenge for us.",

Be honest, you dont need to \"make it up\" is your struggles fit the diagnostic anyway.  \n  \nWe arent broken, just wired slightly differently. Also - it is rooted in genetics AND development, the reasearch on its connection to for ex. autism or PTSD is currently being studied.  \n  \nGenetically, ADHD traces back to people who used to protect tribes from harm. That meant shallow sleep, but - often sleeping and eating all day since nothing happens that needs protecting from :) Theres a good TED talk on this on youtube.\n\nIts more harmful to you and everyone who struggles with these things to try to disprove a condition that is proven to exist than it is to seek help for what you could struggle a lot less with - were you to get a prescripton!",

Our team is in a similar position, we are more of a midsized company (1700 global employees, about 950 full time in US).  We are in the midst of a 6 month trial of Gong Engage and it has been an unmitigated disaster.  We’ve been on Outreach for years and we were researching newer tech that could offer similar functionality with newer AI driven workflows that Outreach simply wasn’t designed for. \n\nGong Engage didn’t even have the basics down.  Our tiger team assigned to the pilot stopped using within a few weeks due to the headaches and clear decline in return compared to outreach.  The AI driven workflows Gong has communicated to the market around Engage is simply nonexistent and too many manual clicks required to setup a basic sequence campaign.  \n\nThe one part of Gong Engage we found useful was the call follow up generator but we’ve found many other providers that can do this same exact thing.\n\nWe are also a Hubspot shop: as others have commented, it is worth standardizing your deal framework and forecasting expectations to make the date in hubspot *somewhat* digestible lol.  \n\nWhat are some the vendors outside of hubspot you are currently partnering with? We’ve used Gong for recording for a few years now and looking to repurpose the core spend elsewhere across a few providers for a fraction of the cost",

I know my competitors pricing. We're the price and quality leader. But we've been losing market share to these pricks, and management decided to match their prices so we stop losing any more customers to them.\n\nSo, I managed to convince management to give a 30% discount, matching their price, reluctantly, in exchange for a commitment from them. He gives me a verbal commitment. 3 days pass by, and I'm following up on the status. Contact stops answering my calls. Only emails me after I cc his boss, and tells me that my competitors discounted 10% more than the final price I quoted.\n\nNow, I'm thinking to myself, if I give him another 10%, he'll come back to me with even more discount requests. Not only that, but he'll think I was overcharging him the whole time. I'm in a pickle. I don't want to lose the deal to those pricks. But, I don't want to lose the customer. They're penny-pinchers, but have a big brand. We often run into them at conferences.\n\nTalked to boss about it, and he agreed to discount further. It's no longer a value discussion. It's a pure price discussion and it's a price war. It's nasty. Newbies, this is the dirty part of sales no one tells you about. You do NOT want to end up in this position.\n\n  \nEdit 1: typos",

If you start out with something low that you can live with, they feel like they’ve gotten one up you.  If you do that though, I’d make the discount valid through the end of the quarter only.

            "selftext": "My current role has gone to shit. I’m performing well but due to some structural changes I’m no longer doing what I was hired to do. On top of that I’m just tired of carrying a bag every month and being at the mercy of knee jerk decisions made by senior leadership. So I’m considering a career change. \n\nA good friend has offered to refer me for an assistant superintendent position at a large GC. The starting pay is $85k plus decent benefits. It’s much less than my current OTE but I can live comfortably on that. Anyone successfully made the jump or come from construction to sales? What am I missing here? Is this a bad idea?",

It's like they pulled a bait and switch on your job description, right?Making the jump from sales to construction is a pretty big move, but sometimes that's exactly what you need to shake things up. $85k might be a pay cut, but if it means not having to deal with quota anxiety and leadership's flavor-of-the-month strategies, it could be worth its weight in gold for your mental health Plus, assistant super positions can be a solid stepping stone. If you're good with people and can manage chaos (which, let's face it, sales probably taught you), you might find yourself climbing the construction ladder pretty quick.Just make sure you're cool with:\n\n1. Potentially long/weird hours\n2. Dealing with all sorts of personalities on job sites\n3. Learning a whole new set of skills and lingo\n\nBut hey, if you're tired of carrying that bag and playing corporate politics, this could be your ticket out. Sometimes a pay cut is worth it for a fresh start and a chance to build something tangible.Whatever you decide, props for considering a bold move. Life's too short to stay in a job that's sucking your soul. Good luck, man!ShareRewrite",

I was able to listen to what other top reps at the company where saying along with getting some training form my manger, however he stopped listening to the calls even thought I was still wanting some to be reviewed. I understand why he did stop because I was out selling everyone on the team. \n\nI credit part of this to Gong and asking question. \n\nIt was great for me to also go back if I was having slow month and listen to the successful calls I had as I would keep track of every deal I closed. Know Most sales reps don't do this which seems to me like they are leaving money on the table. To each their own.\n\nalso know I didn't answer your question. Still wanted to say I don't see Gong as a waste of money, when used correctly. Pretty sure I had listened to more calls than the mangers had lol. It did show in my numbers so gained a lot from using the tool that some may find useful. \n\nIt's not the tool that is useless, it is how it is being used. And I know I will get some shade for saying this yet it is true. Any tool can be used in a useful way if you want it to, yet if you are finding something that is useless won't really help.",

I was trying to get a feel for how they sold and realized the bar was much lower than what management said they wanted for internal promotions. Yet those AEs were still closing deals. It did help me ramp a little quicker but that’s it. I do think it’s useful as a secondary note taker so you can go back to review a couple things. Or if you didn’t close someone on a call you expected to, you could take that to your manager to ask for advice if you guys go over it together. It can be really nice to have, though not a need to have.",

Have you always been 1099, or did you have to pay your dues working with a company until your network was extensive enough to operate as described? Congratulations on the success!",

Just wasn't working out. Maybe my fault but I don't think so. Was small company struggling to enter the US market\n\nAnyway. I said fuck this had enough. And just started doing it myself. \n\nI could start an actual company . But... Why do all that work. Lol.\n\nTechnically I have my own company a LLC but that is only to be able to receive commissions. VS the hell of running a company. No thanks !\n\nAnd it's not so much paid dues as it is just like... Hey I want to do this job on 1099. Works for you hard. You are out nothing. I take the risk\n\nIt's something I don't know why more people don't do",
