                    "body": "as a founder who's sold in the trenches... AND hired reps at multiple early stage sales teams... your current stack (HubSpot + Sales Nav + UpCell) is a decent foundation, but in 2024 (and probably going forward honestly...), winning deals is all about your reps (or the leader) becoming a trusted voice in your space. Here's how I would build a modern stack -- focusing on thought leadership and actually helpful content distribution\n\n**1. Intelligence & Social Selling** (Your bread and butter):\n\n* Keep Sales Navigator (essential for social selling, can't do jack without it)\n* some data provider (ZI is $ but still people use it - I can't shill here, but there's other platforms out there)\n\n**2. Content Distribution & Engagement** (Where deals are won):\n\n* sendspark or loom for personalized video messages (3x higher engagement than traditional outreach)\n* showcase for creating prospect-specific microsites (docsha.re)\n* linkedin smart links for content tracking (i find them too invasive, but meh, some reps like)\n\n**3. Thought Leadership Amplification:**\n\n* LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n* find a content sharing thing that's tied to Linkedin \n\n**4. Meeting Experience:**\n\n* Calendly or chili piper or [cal.com](http://cal.com) for something to schedule with\n* call recording (i've tried them all... nothing is really amazing for sales, but i guess gong if price is no object, or Avoma)\n\n**Pro Tips for 2024:**\n\n1. **Focus on LinkedIn presence first** \\- it's where B2B buyers actually spend time\n2. Create a content library your reps can easily access and share (case studies, insights, market analysis)\n3. Use video AND messages for prospecting - they break through the noise\n4. Track content engagement to understand what actually moves deals forward\n\n I'd actually hold off on heavy email sequences until you have rock-solid deliverability and a strong content strategy.  Crappy spam cannon emails are harming your domain reputation. Instead, focus first on high-impact channels like LinkedIn and personalized video where you can showcase expertise.\n\n**modern buyers are drowning in automated outreach -- just go take a look at a prospects inbox (once they're a customer) and you'll see :)**. Your stack should help reps position themselves as industry experts who add real value. Focus on tools that help deliver insights, not just pitches.",

Our product was almost ready, and we were gearing up for sales. We hired a sales expert, but things didn‚Äôt work out (startup life was too chaotic, no blame there). Then the team had to figure out a plan.\n\nWe tried tons of lead channels, from CRM to email, calls, and more. But here‚Äôs what we did differently, which might be useful to you or give you some new ideas. We decided to go with AI Sales Rep. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre selling, but we‚Äôre in SaaS, so it‚Äôs easy for clients to just pay and start using it.\n\nWe kept things lean since we‚Äôre a small team with limited funds. We let AI handle lead generation and client outreach on LinkedIn and Facebook, building connections, introducing our product, answering questions, and nudging clients to book a call or meeting ‚Äî basically setting up leads. Instead of spreading ourselves thin, we focused on refining our sales strategy, adjusting the product, and prepping for conversion meetings.\n\nWith LinkedIn Sales Navigator and AI, each account was able to request connections from 30-40 people daily, with about half accepting. We ended up having solid conversations with 10-15 people a day, and around 30% would leave their contact info. Our CEO doubled as the main salesperson, handling 3-5 client meetings a day and creating his own pitches. So, we didn‚Äôt over-invest in tools early on. Once things felt stable, we expanded with more tools.",

I‚Äôm using the [AI Sales Rep tool,](https://www.strategybrain.ca/ai-powered-linkedin-revops-solutions/increase-sales-revenue/) and here‚Äôs how it works:\n\nBasically, I upload all product info to the tool ‚Äî things like pricing, company details, product features, benefits, competitor insights, usage guides, and FAQs. Sometimes, I even copy over our website info, blog posts, or FAQs for extra context. The AI learns fast and, based on my target customer range, starts reaching out automatically.\n\nIt personalizes intros depending on the client‚Äôs background. For example, for clients in the Middle East, it uses Arabic; if it‚Äôs a contact who works at Walmart in the U.S., it‚Äôll mention something about Walmart. And if I‚Äôm selling real estate, it‚Äôll ask if they‚Äôre comfortable in their current area. \n\nOnce the client replies, the AI jumps in with product details, answers questions, addresses any concerns, and guides them to leave their contact info. The whole process is hands-off ‚Äî I don‚Äôt need to jump in. Plus, the AI doesn‚Äôt need tons of input to start; for common questions, it even generates replies based on competitor info to fill in the gaps where I haven‚Äôt added specific details. I hope the link I shared doesn‚Äôt come off as spam ‚Äî check out the video if you get a chance! I think it‚Äôs super cool, and I‚Äôm really into it. My struggle now is figuring out how to convince more people to let me use their LinkedIn accounts.

I don‚Äôt know your product, but you may have to get creative with phone and virtual interactions.\n\nIf you‚Äôre seeking less travel and more stability, an inside role is where you‚Äôll find it, but know it‚Äôs a shift in lifestyle/routines and skillset as I mentioned. If you‚Äôre already great with virtual communications, it could be a seamless transition.\n\nBut honestly unless you are burnt out, outside medical device sales is a strong field to stick with.",

We‚Äôre in the high-end 3D rendering and branding space, mostly working with property developers, builders, and designers, with a typical project size between $4,000 and $10,000.\n\nSince it‚Äôs commission-only (about 10% per sale), I‚Äôm curious how others have successfully attracted and kept motivated reps for roles like this. A few questions I have:\n\nWhere do you find good commission-based sales reps? Any specific platforms or communities you‚Äôd recommend?\n\nWhat actually motivates reps in commission-only roles? Is it all about the earning potential, or are there other ways to keep them engaged?\n\nWhat qualities do you look for when hiring for these roles? Anything that shows they‚Äôll thrive in this kind of setup?\n\n\nAppreciate any advice or experiences you‚Äôre willing to share. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "**Hi everyone.**\n\nI work in B2B sales for a company that provides website solutions. I reach out to small and medium-sized businesses that have poor websites or none at all. We usually sell high-quality website templates, with the lowest price we‚Äôre allowed to offer at 1,455 USD, including an annual maintenance fee of 455 USD. I emphasize that we can split the invoice into manageable payments. Since I work on 100% commission, making sales is essential for me.\n\nI‚Äôm in my second month now and have only closed one sale so far (a business that didn‚Äôt have a website at all). It‚Äôs not exactly impressive, so I‚Äôve been tweaking my pitch to see if that improves things. I‚Äôve seen some improvement, but I still feel like my pitch isn‚Äôt quite connecting with customers, and I can tell I‚Äôm not building strong rapport with the people I‚Äôm calling. Most of my calls are cold.\n\nI‚Äôd love to get some feedback on what I might be doing wrong and what I could improve. Here‚Äôs my current pitch:\n\n**Pitch for businesses without a website**\n\nHi, this is () from \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. Am I speaking with (insert name)?\n\nWe help businesses become more visible online through professional websites. I noticed you don‚Äôt currently have a website. These days, more and more customers search online for services, and a website is often the first place they look. Without one, it can be difficult for potential clients to find you.¬†*\\[pause briefly\\]*\n\n**Let the client respond and explain their situation.**  \nThis gives you insight into their thoughts about websites and lets them reflect on their need for one.\n\nWe can set up a simple, professional website for you that makes it easy for customers to find and contact you. I have a few website templates that could be a perfect fit. Would you have time to look at them now, or should we schedule a time that works better?\n\n**If they say they don‚Äôt need one:**¬†‚Ä¢ I understand, but a website can really help you attract new customers, especially when they‚Äôre searching online for services like yours. It also creates a professional impression of your business.\n\nThis package costs 1,455 USD, including annual maintenance at 455 USD. Would you prefer the full amount up front, or would you like to split the payment?\n\n**If they need time to think about it:**¬†‚Ä¢ I understand that you‚Äôd like to consider it. How about we schedule a follow-up chat later this week, so we can go over any questions you might have?",

                    "body": "Sales managers (I am one of them) often have concerns about people that have never sold before, because inexperienced salespeople often do not realize what a negative, high pressure job selling actually is.  The average close rate on all leads for a B2B sales rep is in the 7% range.  That means for every YES you get, you also get nine NO's.  When you add in the fact that your compensation is affected every month by your close rate, it makes for a very stressful situation.  I used to hire newbies for sales positions, but got tired of them coming into my office after a couple of months of selling, breaking down in tears, and telling me that they cannot handle the pressure and negativity.  One way to show hiring managers that you can handle sales is to actually do some as someone else has already posted.  Get a part-time job (nights/weekends) selling something, anything to show that you can handle such work.",

Unlike Apollo, my software offers access to an unlimited number of contacts, but the niches it covers are slightly more limited.\n\nI'm looking to effectively market this service and reach potential customers who would benefit from a more budget-friendly option. Here are a few questions I have:\n\n1. **Marketing Strategies:** What are some effective ways to market a product like this? Any specific channels or tactics you‚Äôve found successful?\n2. **Target Audience:** How can I identify and reach the right audience that would be interested in my software? Any tips on tailoring my message to different niches?\n3. **Sales Techniques:** What are some persuasive selling points I can emphasize when promoting my software compared to Apollo.io?\n4. **Feedback and Improvement:** If you've launched a similar product, what lessons did you learn during your initial sales efforts that could help me avoid common pitfalls?\n\nAny insights or tips you can share would be greatly appreciated!

No matter how refined our processes are, it feels like there‚Äôs a never-ending struggle to consistently attract the right prospects. I‚Äôve also found CRM systems can be overly complex, often getting in the way instead of helping. Simplified, user-friendly tools would make a world of difference. Sometimes, it feels like the systems are designed to complicate rather than assist. Over the years, these pain points haven't completely gone, but learning to adapt and streamline what we can helps manage the stress a bit.",

There are so many complex platforms out there claiming to solve the lead quality problem, but very few actually deliver the right fit for finding qualified leads. I've tried many of these systems myself, and most are large, cumbersome, and packed with features you rarely use but still pay a monthly fee for. Often, you‚Äôre locked into costly subscriptions, which isn‚Äôt ideal, especially for smaller businesses and startups that might not have extensive tech resources. These companies are looking for a simple, user-friendly tool that delivers high-quality leads without the monthly commitment.\n\nI spent a long time searching and testing different options, and for the past few months, I've been using [leadlister.ai](http://leadlister.ai) It‚Äôs a straightforward platform where you pay per lead.

Like many of you, I was exploring different strategies to get more eyes on my site, but I wanted to try something a bit out of the box.\n\nOne unconventional approach I took was **hosting a free weekly webinar series** on digital marketing tips. I created a simple event on Facebook and invited people to join me for a live session where I shared practical strategies for improving online presence. Participants could ask questions in real-time, and I made sure to offer actionable insights that they could implement right away. It was a hit! Not only did I see an increase in engagement, but attendees began sharing the event with their networks, which brought in even more participants.\n\nTo capitalize on this traffic, I also exported **unlimited leads** using **WarpLeads** to reach out to those who showed interest but hadn‚Äôt signed up for my services yet. I created personalized follow-up emails highlighting how my consultancy could help them achieve their marketing goals, and it really made a difference.\n\nBy the end of the month, my site traffic had increased significantly, and I even converted a few attendees into paying clients. This experience taught me the value of building a community and engaging directly with potential clients.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear from you all, what unconventional strategies have you tried that worked well for you? Looking forward to your thoughts!",

One unconventional strategy I've found effective is partnering with complementary businesses for co-hosted events or content collaborations. It not only broadens your audience but also adds extra value for participants.\n\nI teamed up with a friend who runs a graphic design studio, and we created a joint workshop series. It was a hit and brought in clients we wouldn't have reached individually.\n\nTo manage the outreach and coordination, I started using Dexy AI. It automated personalized messages on LinkedIn and email, which made the whole process a lot smoother.\n\nKeep experimenting with new ideas, sounds like you're on a roll!",

The beauty of networking is its personal touch‚Äîit lets you reach potential clients through trusted connections, essentially opening doors through referrals.\n\nTake BNI, for example; they excel at structured networking that empowers members to achieve goals by helping others first (as their motto, \"Givers Gain,\" reflects). Building trust in networking takes time but pays off immensely. I'll be discussing networking strategies throughout November, so stay tuned!

The structure works for novices and experienced networkers alike, it forces you to deliver consistent results. My chapter was particularly good for trades, 1 lead in created a wealth of work for members.  Where it falls down is on some of the afters , the constant training the area franchise holders make you do, the scoring and the self governing nature of the chapters. \n\nThe group in theory Becomes your salesforce.\n\nThe problem for me was it limited my referral giving, I tend have a dozen accountants i give work to - one accountant isn't getting it all because they all refer back to me as well.\n\nSo the model didn't work for me. I did 2 years made a few quid but in the end gave it up.\n\nThe other manufactured networking wannabes ape some of the BNI features but tend to focus less on the passing and recording of leads and the 60 seconds  because its \"too pressurised\" in favour of meetings between the members. They end up being talking shops. \n\nBut none of this is actual networking that you would do at a trade show event or just on a day to day basis, where i do far better.",

Compared to traditional ABM ads it‚Äôs light years ahead.\n\nThat means only your designated targets see your ads, no ad waste, unqualified leads, and all at a significantly cheaper cost than traditional targeting.\n\nIf you have ran B2B ads, you know they perform pretty bad. This fixes the problem.\n\nWhile we are building our platform I‚Äôm looking to manually perform the method with some individuals in exchange for testimonials and use cases!\n\n  \n*One thing to note is it works best for USA targets! Still works globally, just not as well.*\n\n  \nIf you are interested shoot me a DM and let me know.",

                    "body": "In my experience, cold outreach on LinkedIn‚Äîespecially in IT services and SaaS‚Äîis really about understanding your ICP and keeping things personal and genuine. The first step I‚Äôd recommend is just making that initial connection feel natural, not like you‚Äôre already trying to sell. A simple intro mentioning something specific about their role, a shared interest, or even just acknowledging their recent post works well for me. This approach is less about pushing for an immediate reply and more about creating familiarity.\n\nAfter that, if they connect, what worked for me is a follow-up that adds value, not a pitch. Sharing a relevant insight or a short case study tends to get attention because it shows you‚Äôve done your homework on their industry. Think of it as building up the relationship so they start associating your name with useful, industry-specific information rather than a straight sales angle.\n\nAnd when it feels right, I like to add in a nudge to set up a quick chat. I keep it casual‚Äîpeople can tell if it‚Äôs low-pressure and consultative rather than a hard pitch. In my view, the trick with LinkedIn cold outreach is really about making every touchpoint feel intentional and relevant, avoiding anything that feels mass-produced. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked best for me.\n\nJoe G",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nso my brother and I have started an IT company for Software Development and Infrastructure Administration / Optimization for SMBs in Germany a few years ago. We both are full-blood tech guys and so we have a hard time getting new customers (I think mainly because SEO does not work very well for this type of business). So we relied on our network, which worked in the beginning to get a few customers.\n\nNow after some years of COVID and the bad economic state that Germany is in, businesses are even more careful and our network seems to be exhausted for new potential clients.\n\nI started trying cold-emailing and to post content on LinkedIn for more visibility but I have a hard time continuing this as there are 0 results from this.\n\nI hoped, maybe some of you can help me with some insights or tips of how you would approach this situation (e.g. try LinkedIn Messages for acquisition). How can I grow my network the best? Just cold contacting or some other way?\n\nAny insight is very welcome.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

Y Combinator's \"Co-founder Match\" is definitely a tool I‚Äôd recommend exploring; it‚Äôs designed exactly for situations like yours, where you need someone to complement your skill set. You'll likely find a range of candidates with B2B sales experience who can help scale your typing test SaaS beyond your current contracts.\n\nSales in SaaS, especially for B2B, requires a deep understanding of outreach and relationship building, so someone with that background can help you leverage those existing contracts and build a more systematic sales approach. Going the route of a commission-based start makes sense to minimize risk at the beginning. If they‚Äôre able to consistently drive results, a more formal partnership could be the perfect next step for growth.\n\n[https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching](https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching)\n\n  \nJoe G",

Video is such a solid approach, especially since it adds that human touch. A few tools I've found helpful for personalization in email outreach:\n\n**1. Vidyard & Loom**: Great for quick, personalized videos without needing much editing. People really respond well when they see a face with a friendly intro. Vidyard even lets you embed the video thumbnail, which improves click-through rates.\n\n**2. Hyperise**: This tool lets you personalize images in emails by dynamically adding a prospect‚Äôs name or company logo to visuals, which works well with B2B leads since it catches their attention fast.\n\n**3. Crystal**: For text-based personalization, Crystal uses personality insights based on LinkedIn profiles. It‚Äôs not 100% perfect, but it‚Äôs a cool way to adapt your messaging style to what might resonate best with each lead.\n\n**4. Lemlist**: Great for including dynamic fields and personalized images in your cold emails. They have a lot of creative options, like adding a prospect‚Äôs website screenshot into the email, which makes it look super tailored.\n\nHope this helps! Always love seeing new tools on the market; if LeadsEngager offers anything unique, feel free to share‚ÄîI‚Äôd be curious to check it out!",

Lead Generation Platforms**: Sites like HomeAdvisor and Thumbtack often attract homeowners looking for smart home and security solutions. They‚Äôre paid platforms, but the leads tend to be high-quality and ready to engage.\n\n**2. Facebook Ads & Google Ads**: These can be really effective if you run targeted campaigns based on location and demographics (homeowners, tech-savvy individuals, etc.). Set a modest budget and experiment with a few ad variations to find what resonates.\n\n**3. Local Partnerships**: Partner with local real estate agents or property managers‚Äîthey often work with homeowners who may want smart security systems in new homes. Consider offering a small referral fee to incentivize them.\n\n**4. Community Groups & Forums**: Sites like Nextdoor and neighborhood Facebook groups can be good for finding people interested in home security. Just be sure to follow group rules to avoid spamming.\n\nBest of luck closing more deals, and if you have success with any of these methods, feel free to share! Always on the lookout for new ways to reach clients.",

There's not a day without some BS happening, right? Out of curiosity, are there specific things you‚Äôre looking to get in order before making a decision?\"\n\nNow you gotta make it sound playful and completely non-business-like tonality so it doesn't feel like you're pressuring them into an answer but having 2 dudes sharing the same struggle. \n\nThe only time I pressure them is when I'm arranging the following phone call and just assume for them that talking in 2 weeks(depending on the issues) is very reasonable based on his workload.",

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked for me:\n\n* **Be Polite & Respectful:**¬†Treat the gatekeeper like a decision-maker.\n* **Ask for Help:**¬†People love being helpful. A simple, \"I was hoping you could point me in the right direction\" works wonders.\n* **Mention Referrals:**¬†If you have a name, drop it early.\n* The last point and its a bit of a naughty one. IF the gatekeeper gives you there name. Then by using toneality just go \"Hey Jenna, this is (Your name), how are you guys doing. (Wait for them to reply), ah ok, is (Prospect name) in or maybe out for a coffe again?\" The main point is that the toneality suggest that you speak with a familier tonelity that suggest you have spoken with them before and its just a normal day. It works wonders. It dosent work everytime but will increase your chances by alot. Key is toneality!!!\n\nFor more detailed strategies, I‚Äôve created a course that covers this for $14.99.

Also, keep your messages concise and highlight how you can add value to them.\n\nI was in a similar situation and found that engaging with prospects' posts and being active in relevant industry groups helped build rapport before reaching out.

They have some package that costs around 30 bucks with unlimited calls to USA and Canada, that's what I have. You have a  phone number and others are able to see the caller id. And clients can reach you by video call using the same phone number.\n\nNever failed so far. Call from phone and PC. The downside is they want some extra cash for features like scheduler which threw me off a bit, but if you're just looking to call it's a good option. Zadarma is good as well, no features beside a pure phone call but it's cheaper (for the minutes per month I am using)\n\nI see lots of people selling these kinds of services masking as advice, so just to be clear, I am not working for Zoom or I am in any way related to them. \n\nCheers and good luck!",

What expectations should we set?\n\nWhat can we do to help set them up for success?

Most Founders fail in their first Sales hires, and the fail rate is even higher if they were doing the selling for a variety reasons.  I would tell them what you have done that has worked, then test them on what you taught them.  If they can‚Äôt figure that part out, you made a bad hire.  After that, measure them on pipeline growth and closed sales.  On activity metrics, if you make the right hire, they will do the right things.  You should check in on that daily in the beginning, but do it in the spirit of, ‚Äúwhat is working, what is not and how can I help?‚Äù.  Don‚Äôt tell them they need to make 100 calls a day unless that is what you want from them over pipeline and revenue.  I could go on, but I would start with getting the right person (culturally, attitude, coachable, etc.) and measure what matters.  Sorry, but without more information, not a lot more I can give you.  I can tell you that people that think that one set of KPI‚Äôs and processes work across all Sales have either not been successful or if they were, it was probably one time.  Every situation has commonality and every situation is a little unique.",

Opening a sale is an art, closing it is just as challenging, and proper follow-up is something not many do well. In my experience, you‚Äôll need at least two people on your sales team.\n\nThe first is the **opener**, who excels at cold calls, cold emails, and networking. Once they‚Äôve warmed up a prospect, they pass them to the **closer**, who is more numbers-driven, understands negotiation techniques, and doesn‚Äôt accept ‚Äúno‚Äù as an answer. This combination is the most effective. You could try hiring one person to do both, but you‚Äôll likely find they‚Äôre better at either opening or closing, leaving a gap in your process.\n\nAs for compensation, you can split the commission between the two, with the closer taking the larger share. This way, each person plays to their strengths, and your sales process becomes much smoother and more effective.\n\nHope this helps!",

Start with a clear compensation package that combines a stable base salary (perhaps higher during the 3-6 month ramp-up period) with a transparent commission structure. Create a welcoming environment through a structured 30-60-90 day onboarding plan and regular check-ins that go beyond just numbers. Make sure they have the tools to succeed by budgeting for professional development, whether that's training, conferences, or mentorship opportunities. Set clear expectations about work environment (remote/office), hours, and who to go to for support, but give them autonomy to develop their approach. Establish a regular rhythm of communication through weekly 1:1s, monthly development conversations, and quarterly reviews. Remember to celebrate wins, both big and small, and create a culture where they feel comfortable giving honest feedback. The goal is to make them feel valued beyond just their sales numbers and see themselves as a key part of building something meaningful.",

When I started in online sales, especially for tech products, I felt like I was drowning in info. But here's what I learned: focus on understanding your customer first. \n\n  \nFor online education and tech, the key is solving real problems. Start by researching your target audience's pain points. What are they struggling with? Is it time management, information overload, or maybe tech integration? \n\n  \nI'd suggest focusing on platforms where your audience hangs out. LinkedIn can be great for B2B, while Instagram or TikTok might work better for B2C in ed-tech. Learn one platform really well before moving to the next.\n\n  \nAs for skills, work on your copywriting and data analysis. Being able to craft compelling messages and understand metrics is crucial.\n\n  \nOne big challenge in online education is student engagement and retention. Sales can help by focusing on long-term value rather than just the initial sale. Show how your product keeps students motivated and learning effectively.\n\n  \nTo stay focused, set specific goals and track your progress. It's easy to get distracted by every new tactic, but consistency is key. \n\n  \nIn my experience with Opencord AI, we've found that automating certain aspects of social media engagement can really help salespeople focus on what matters most - building relationships and solving problems. It's all about working smarter, not harder.\n\n  \nRemember, the best salespeople are problem solvers. Keep that mindset, and you'll do great!",

If not, slide into messages with value and endorsements. \n\nThis slow-burn approach has upped my response rate big time. It‚Äôs all about playing it cool and not pitching right away.\n\nPlease let me know thoughts and feel free DM any suggestions or questions...",

I've had positive experiences with firms like LeadGen Partners and SalesHive - they specialize in tech industries and might be a good fit for you.\n\nWhen my company faced similar challenges, we realized that traditional firms didn't quite grasp our niche needs. We started looking into alternative solutions that were more tailored to our industry.\n\nActually, we began using an AI tool called Dexy AI that automates outbound prospecting and personalizes outreach across LinkedIn and email. It was like having an extra team member working around the clock, and it saved us a lot compared to hiring a traditional firm.\n\nHope you find the right partner to boost your sales efforts. Best of luck!",

Your college may have a department that does things like help prep for job interviews, review your resume, and find job opportunities.  Mine did 20 years ago, but I was also at a large state school.  \n  \nMake sure you are connected on LinkedIn to everyone from your internships and prior part time roles, and that you have a profile with a good professional photo on it.  Some of those companies may be hiring, or people may have moved on.  Look at their connections, and see if there are any recruiters they are connected to.  You could try cold outreaching to them - if you're going to be in sales, cold outreach is part of the job, so practice it! :)\n\nLook up the 3 largest Chambers of Commerce in your area.  Get on their e-mail lists, find out their schedules, and show up to their next 2-3 networking events dressed appropriately.  Be personable and be interested in what value the participating businesses bring to their customers.  Don't be overly pushy about looking for a job; it'll come up when you are talking to people and trading the basic intro info of \"What company are you with?\" and \"What do you do?\"\n\n  \nNetworking is your friend, and face to face networking is far more effective than just blasting a bunch of e-mails/LinkedIn invitations... but it's best to combine both.  Keep the business cards for people you meet, or write down their names, and send connection invitations later.\n\nThink back to your most memorable good and bad experiences during your internships.  Write down the story of each, and be prepared to share it in a job interview or during a networking event as an anecdote.",

Is he stalling? I have asked him a couple of times, but he keeps saying he is busy and will share. This happened many times. I want to start the work asap and get paid aswell. Am i being paranoid? ",

Send your follow-up, but keep looking for new prospects. The worst thing you can do is stay static, waiting for this sale to happen. If after a while they still haven‚Äôt given you a clear response, set a deadline.

I totally get it‚ÄîI‚Äôve been there myself as a startup founder.\n\nTo make things a little easier, we‚Äôve created two AI tools that can help:\n\n1. **AI Cold Calling Tool**¬†‚Äì You can either give us your data (or use ours), and let us know the offer you want your ICP to hear. Our AI then makes the calls and identifies hot leads who are actually interested in your offer.\n2. **LinkedIn AI Tool**¬†‚Äì This tool connects with your buyer persona automatically. After they accept, it sends up to 3 follow-up messages if needed. Plus, our AI does the research beforehand to personalize your outreach as much as possible.\n\nIf you think either of these tools might help, I‚Äôd be happy to give you a quick demo. Just let me know!",

It's designed to handle typical objections and adapt to different conversation flows using pre-programmed responses based on your sales goals. \n\nFor more nuanced or unexpected objections, the AI can escalate the call for a human follow-up if needed. It‚Äôs particularly useful in qualifying leads like Basic Qualified Leads (BQL), Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL), and Sales Qualified Leads (SQL), ensuring your team focuses on prospects with real interest‚Äã. \n\n# LinkedIn AI Tool\n\nOur LinkedIn AI Lead Generation tool leverages personalization without sacrificing efficiency. It automatically researches each prospect to ensure personalized outreach while maintaining a high volume of connections and follow-ups. \n\nThe tool sends up to three follow-up messages if needed, and it has shown to increase response rates by up to 5x, helping sales teams grow their pipelines‚Äã",

Tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator can help you identify and connect with the right prospects more effectively. Additionally, personalizing your outreach and taking the time to comment thoughtfully on others' posts can foster stronger relationships.\n\nIn my experience, focusing on genuine interactions rather than just sales pitches has made a significant difference in building trust with my connections. Regularly sharing industry insights and participating in discussions has helped me establish credibility.\n\nLately, I've been using Dexy AI to automate some of my personalized outreach on LinkedIn. It's helped me stay connected with my network without losing that personal touch, making relationship-building a bit easier.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck enhancing your LinkedIn engagement!",
