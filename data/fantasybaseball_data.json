Toby meant low risk low reward. Hipster meant I'm waiting for this guy to put it all together and I don't want to drop because as soon as I do, he'll be good (but while he's on my roster, he won't be good).\n\nSo now cherry bomb means almost ace which sorta makes sense because when they're on, it will be ace level stuff, but when they aren't, it'll be rough. Toby means toby with higher upside (isn't that holly?) and hipster is high risk high reward but likely to reward a bit less? Did I get that right? Isn't toby *supposed* to be boring?",

As good as he can be when he's healthy, the fact he can be a top-5 pitcher in half a season doesn't feel good enough when he's had half a season's innings once in the last 5 seasons. IMO, he has the highest risk of anyone on the list, yet he's ranked at what I think is still closer to his ceiling than his median outcome.\n\nWe'll see where the ADPs settle on these guys, but if we consider this an ADP guide, I'd much rather wait and 1-2 more rounds for a guy like Gilbert, Kirby, or Ragans, and use that deGrom-tier pick on someone who will give me stable production near the top of my draft.",

Volatile strikeout arm who you so badly want to drop and may end up hurting you more than helping. This is the old Cherry Bomb.",

Dang, I'm sorry I disappointed you last year.\n\nI'm always trying to improve each year and there are a few lessons I'm taking away from 2024's rankings:\n\n- Fewer injury dings as so many pitchers get injured anyway\n- Don't chase volume guys after the ones who are potential 25%+\n- Lean harder into pitchers with 80th+ percentile extension & two great fastballs (4S, SI, 90+ mph CT) they can earn 60%+ strikes with\n- Focus on fastball dominance for RP --> SP (ReyLo and Crochet worked! Hall and Puk didn't...though their heaters got worse since RP).\n\nWho were the ones last year that you felt I was wrong about when I ranked them - not in retrospect as the season progressed? That is, what were the traps you believe I fell into instead of \"This was bad because it wasn't 100% accurate\"? After all, there's only so much we can do to try to predict the season ahead and there is no way we can be completely correct!\n\nThanks!

It’s never going to be so obvious there's always a guy like Seth Lugo or Ronel Blanco who surprises everyone. \n\nAnd as many metrics as we baseball nerds invent, it’s impossible to synthesize the art of pitching into a data collection. We can't quantify the mental aspects of pitching, but that’s just as important as anything pitching-related. \n\nLastly, I think many fantasy baseball experts will tell you not to chase wins, but if you have a talent for predicting team win totals, you can get a feel for who to boost in your rankings. It’s an important category. Last year, 14 of the top 20 on the player rated were top 20 in wins, including the top seven.",

It's not overly in depth with advanced stats or anything but it's definitely the best in terms of entertainment and production value. They are daily M-F (1 hour) episodes plus a 5 minute Saturday podcast during the preseason and throughout the regular season. From October until January they drop to 3 one hour episodes per week. Frank does a great job in getting these shows together. This one is definitely the one I'd recommend to newer fantasy players. I've been listening to it for over a decade.\n\nThere are other podcasts out there that I listen to that are more in depth but the vast majority of them have hosts that are hard to listen to for varying reasons and many are sporadic about when episodes appear. My biggest problem with most is obnoxious hosts or terrible sound quality.",

                    "body": "The deGrom ranking definitely strikes me as the strangest of the bunch. It's been 5 years since he threw a full season, and I've learned the hard way several times that \"he's so good when he DOES start\" is often a problem at the worst time (see: my ownership of Tyler Glasnow in the playoffs).\n\nThat Chris Sale led all pitchers in fWAR, is a year younger, and sits lower on the list than deGrom just doesn't seem to mesh with anything logical. And given the trajectory of the Rays for 2025, I wonder if McClanahan is at risk of a Crochet-like 2025, where the end of the season's games mean nothing and the team babies him into the fantasy playoffs after a year off.\n\nAs fickle as pitching can be, I still think the list undersells reliability from guys like Kirby and Gilbert, who are still on the younger side and have given consecutive seasons of top-10 performance. Kirby seems especially snubbed, as he's consistently been on the top-10 fringe for the past 2 seasons, but he's behind Pablo Lopez, whose stats are almost universally worse than Kirby's every year.\n\nIn the last 2 seasons, Kirby's ERA is nearly half a run better. He's got fewer than half the walks. His WHIP is a 0.12 better (a lot for WHIP). His FIP is a little better. The wins are basically a push (+1 for Lopez), as are the innings (+2 for Kirby). IMO, you have to drastically prefer strikeouts to give Lopez's 4.08 ERA and 1.19 WHIP (both worsts in a full season) over the younger Kirby.\n\nThere's a lot of overall nitpicking that can be done, but I think the biggest takeaways are that the top tier is way too large and has a disproportionate weight towards ceiling when there's extreme risk in guys who haven't had a full MLB season as an ace since COVID, if ever (Lopez, deGrom, McClanahan, others).",

Hmmmm\n\nWoo only threw 121 innings last year. Yes, they were very good 121 innings, but is he truly ahead of those other four? I understand injury concerns with Snell & Grayson, but I'd still like to see Woo toss 150-160 innings before I put him at the top of that pack. (And Cease is included in the \"don't think they have consistency\" tier despite starting \\*at least\\* 32 games for four stright years?)\n\nWhile I love me some Michael King, is he really to be ranked higher than Gerrit Cole? Is this due to concerns about age & injury--but acknwoledging that Cole is too good to be included in the age/injury concern tier?\n\nI was curious where Cristopher Sanchez would be ranked, as I'm contemplating using a keeper pick on him. He's included in the \"Solid veterans without much excitement: tier\", despite going into his age-28 season after his first All-Star season with 30+ starts & 180 innings? He doesn't have a lot of wear on that arm, (Yes, he wasn't very good during July & August, but neither were the entire Phillies team during that stretch.)\n\nWasn't Manaea one of the best pitchers in the second half in 2024, helping save the Mets' season? He's shown that he could be good before--are you not buying it, or do injury concerns trump that second half performance?\n\nWill Reid Detmers \\*ever\\* deliver? It seems like the past 2-3 seasons I've gotten him on draft day, to pretty much regret that decision by mid-April.\n\nIt's so sad to see Triston Mackenzie in the \"high risk\" tier heading into his age-27 season.\n\nWhat about Eury Perez? Is expected to miss \\*both\\* the 2024 & 2025 seasons?\n\nAnyways, those are some thoughts & questions I have while reviewing the list.",

However, he would have had a very low win total, and his T-50th finish in Ks would have been rather unimpressive for someone whose ranking would have possibly had him picked in the first 3 rounds.\n\nIn H2H, he didn't pitch after the ASB. That's not a great outcome for a playoff team. I would have seen taking that gamble in the 2021 draft, sure. He had a phenomenal 2019, 2020 wasn't anything worth projecting, and 33 isn't THAT scary of an age for an ace pitcher with a track record. After that season though, I would have immediately started panicking about being a deGrom owner, even with the great rates. Having to replace your ace for half a season, including the playoffs, isn't the kind of investment you want to see.\n\nAll of that still doesn't address that deGrom's innings have only gone DOWN since then, he's older, and the likelihood he'll even reach 90 innings feels worse than 50-50.\n\nI overall think there's very inconsistent logic to dump Strider way down the list because of missed time, but make deGrom top-10 because missing time doesn't matter a whole lot.\n\nIf you only look at June-October for 2023 (when Strider was 2nd in fWAR), Strider's 3.2 fWAR in 123 innings would have ranked T-24th among the full season, yet he's knocked down to 44th. Even in his 2022 season, he was 8th in fWAR in only 130 innings. He's shown the same kind of \"phenomenal, regardless of innings\" potential, but his more recent performances and age get totally discarded. I'd even say the same for Glasnow, who is consistently a top-10 pitcher when he's on the mound, and is probably going to have more innings than deGrom while missing a third of the season himself.",

You don’t have to agree that he will throw that many. \n\nAt this point in October we have no idea when Strider is coming back. We assume May/June but we won’t have any clear timetable until he starts throwing. DeGrom ended the season healthy and in an MLB rotation, so I’m more optimistic about his health in the first half of the season. \n\nAlso, Glasnow is a good pitcher but he threw a career high innings this year and was not a top 15 SP so we can’t say he’ll be a top 10 SP when healthy. Also, he is currently injured and allegedly not planning to have surgery. That’s major red flag for me.\n\nBut, again, these are just my rankings based on my opinion and SP rankings are so WILDLY subjective that I fully expect many people to have vastly different lists. Nobody is going to have the same rankings. ",
