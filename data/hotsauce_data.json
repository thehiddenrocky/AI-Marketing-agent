Tasting 100+ sauces in one day was insane, but I managed to narrow it down to 30 bottles worth bringing home (for now!). I haven’t cracked open all of them yet, but Rockin’ Rasta from Hell’s Kitchen Hot Sauce has already taken a top spot.\n\nIf you haven’t tried Rockin’ Rasta, it’s a medium-heat curry sauce with a thick, satisfying texture that coats perfectly. The curry depth really stands out, bringing something unique to the table without overwhelming the spice. Hell’s Kitchen, as a whole, really nails both texture and flavor – everything I’ve had from them has had a fantastic consistency that’s rich and hearty.\n\nIf anyone else was at the expo or has tried Hell’s Kitchen sauces, what were your favorites? I’d love to hear more recommendations as I work my way through this new stash!",

That was probably 15-20 years ago? I'll try new sauces and spices here and there, switch it up time to time, kick the lesser ones out to my work's breakroom to usher in the latest and greatest to my spicy rack in the fridge at home.\n\nCurrently, I tap out at Bunster's STB, which is *mild* to some people. That's okay though. I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone, and I thoroughly enjoy every hot sauce I keep. Never once has it occurred to me to try and 'train' my tolerance.\n\nHelp me understand. Why try to force it? Tolerance builds naturally.",

A lot of obsession with the fire shits and stuff around here in the last year or two as well....\n\nIn my opinion, heat/spicy is either enjoyable or it's not.  As I age a bit, it really depends on my mood on any given day what I use or how hot I go.  Any legit super hot product in almost all cases is still hot to me, and while I can expect the level of heat I may experience, it's still hot....",

Mouth burn I can handle stomach, severe stomach cramps Im not a fan of. \n\nI will agree with you though... I kind of wish milder sauces still did for me what they used to. \n\nFor anyone wondering, to build my tolerance I just started buying the canned whole jalapeno peppers from the Hispanic section of the grocery store. Ate them a few times a week. Then upgraded to the canned Serrano's when I got used to those. That should prepare you for almost any hot sauce for sure. Not many sauces are as bad as eating 3 or 4 of the pickled Serrano's. They burn much longer than the sauce in my experience.",

This sauce was a gift from my mom a while ago. I'm not sure where she grabbed it, but this sauce is fairly available since it's a fairly popular brand and this sauce is one of their top selling. I enjoyed this sauce mostly while listening to some albums to give them another chance, hence The Black Dahlia Murder photo in the background. (RIP Trevor)... There's something strangely peaceful about gobbling down a breakfast burrito with some delicious hot sauce while blasting metal. It's been raining off and on where I live, so I was able to admire that while analyzing this sauce. Let's get into the review. My first impression from the smell of this sauce is the earthiness of the pepper smell. This sauce has a bit more heat than the smell would lead you to believe. I had to resist slapping my 76 year old boss when he said it smells like Tabasco. How dare you, old man?! Anyway, this sauce is rather runny, which personally I don't mind the consistency of most sauces, and this isn't super runny like a Tabasco would be, but also isn't think and chunky like I am. The heat level is quite nice. I would say its right on the line of a high-medium and hot. A sauce novice may find it unappealing in that regard. The serrano flavor is more obvious than the reaper pepper flavor (which is something I like about the sauce). The sweet factor is brought in by maple syrup, which truthfully, I picked up some days and not others. And when I did catch it, it's like someone whispered \"Maapplllleeee\" in the other room. I guess what I'm saying is that a person who may not like sweetness in sauces would appreciate this sauce. The garlic flavor is awesome. I know black garlic has a more rich earthy flavor, and perhaps thats why I got that smell right off the bat. I would recommend this sauce to someone who is trying to push their tolerance. Bravado is a good company overall, and I would advocate for them in a debate. Rest in Peace, Spicy Prince\n\nFeel free to recommend other sauces by this brand, suggestions of other sauces that have Carolina Reaper, or tell us your experience with this sauce!\n\n**Ingredients:** Red Serrano Pepper Puree (red serrano peppers, salt and acetic acid), Distilled Vinegar (diluted with water to 4% acidity), Carolina Reaper Pepper Puree (carolina reaper peppers, salt, acetic acid), Pure Maple Syrup, Roasted Garlic (garlic and water), Black Garlic, Black Pepper.",

Just pepper mashes across all heat levels.

Got to Da Bomb, and it fucking hurt. We aint no chumps, and we hacked it, but we both agreed it was flavorless and a fucking novelty. It basically nuked our taste buds to the point that we couldnt give a fair assessment to The Last Dab. \n\nFuck Da Bomb. Its a party favor, like a 19 yr old kid funneling a fifth of Wild Turkey at a frat party.",

I don't hang out in a lot of disparate, eclectic social circles, like rubbing elbows with professional businesses in hot sauce making nor do I hang out with prize-winning, competitive chilli makers.\n\n So my perspective is wide open on the subject of what Da Bomb was truly created for. I'm open to the possibility of it being purely just a gimmick sauce, something you have a laugh at and buy only once and throw in the garbage, but I'm also not as pessimistic as you make yourself sound. But is it so outlandish and impossible to think there's no chance where repeat buyers, returning customers of Da Bomb happen? No, I think there's definitely a chance that happens too.",

There is nothing particularly interesting in the sauce on the left, it is delicious, gently hot and spicy with warming aftertaste.  \n\nThe sauce on the right turned out to be the most interesting of the presented, very concentrated smoked taste, bourbon in composition and aroma, the aftertaste lasts for 10-15 minutes, it is interesting even just to inhale it. It feels like you seat next to a campfire. I ordered 4 more sauces from this producer.",

I blended it up with some of the brine and added a little vinegar for flavor.  \n\nI filled the bottles (unevenly)and simmered them for around ten minutes before inverting them and then refrigerating.  \n\nIt’s super tasty!  The overall heat level is medium-low, but a little of that ghost flavor seeps through.   It’s also ultra tangy.  It strangely reminds me a lot of Kimchi - fermented tangy funky with a nice strong pepper and garlic flavor.   \n\nI also love the color that came out.  \n\nI’m looking forward to trying a new ferment soon.  This could get addicting.  ",

Look at your own example, Brooklyn Dehli didn't invent those sauces, they took long existing ones and just used local ingredients. In your world they would probably never have gotten off the ground as some giant corpo would have gone through all international foods long before them and secured rights for all of those types of sauces\n\nMaking recipes protected would skyrocket the price of all basic foods as the richest companies monopolized all of their underlying recipes and got rid of all competition. It's the fact that any bozo can stand up manufacturing and compete that drives our food costs down. But you would prefer paying an arm and a leg for everything and letting masses of people die due to being unable to afford monopolized foods. \n\nIt's eye opening how people cannot think through ridiculous theories and plainly see the long term outcome. \"I want monopolies for all of my food\" is so absurd and that's literally what you're asking for",

            "selftext": "This is my batch of hot sauces I have bottled up this fall. The four flavors are:\n\nChicago Style Pepper Sauce: \nHeat level = 3/10\nBottles available: x9\n\n- A sauce that is my own recipe/creation. A super mild, flavorful pepper sauce that is great for dipping in just about anything, but I originally designed it to go well with Chicago style street foods like hot dogs, italian beef, pizza and more. I wanted to create a sauce that captured the flavors of sport peppers, pickled pepperoncinis and mustard, with a good amount of pleasant tang and solid pepper flavor without the heat! \n\nMedium Cayenne and Garlic Hot Sauce: \nHeat level = 5/10\nBottles available = 4\n\n- A milder/medium take on my Louisiana style cayenne sauce, with a little additional garlic to help brighten up the flavors. A great sauce to use on fried chicken, pizza, chips, eggs and just about anything else. Lots of that great, cayenne flavor with a calmer heat level combined with a nice, tangy sauce bursting with flavor. Also great as a wing sauce cooked with some butter. \n\nSpicy Cayenne Hot Sauce:\nHeat level = 7/10\nBottles available = 10\n\n- My own classic aged Louisiana style table hot sauce, but with a sharp, fiery heat on the front of the tongue. A bit fruity (like red strawberry without the sweetness), yet still takes itself serious. Great on everything my medium cayenne sauce would go on, but a little more heat level without being too spicy. \n\nVery Spicy Habanero Hot Sauce:\nHeat level = 9/10\nBottles available = 3\n\n- A very heat forward habanero hot sauce with lots of the tropical fruit and floral tastes you expect from a habanero hot sauce, combined with carrots, onion and garlic to calm down the heat a little. Goes great on eggs, tacos and soups.",

Sure it was the spiciest chili was it wasn’t the fastest chile by far.  \n\nI feel like if you want a soup/chili, whatever spicy, get just one (or more depending on you tolerate), wash it and then cut slits into the pepper.  Just enough to let it open up but everything is still attached to the stem.  Leave the seeds and everything inside sell.  Then after you make your dish and are just letting it simmer, put the pepper in the pot and let the whole, sliced pepper simmer in what you’re cooking. \n\nWhen you’re ready to eat or it’s gotten to your spicy level, grab the stem and pull the whole pepper out (like a Basel leaf).  That way you not only get the spicy that the flat line offers but you will get the flavor that your favorite pepper has.",
