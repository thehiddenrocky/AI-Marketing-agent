I just mean that there really isn't anything special in the Finnish biotech field that you wouldn't find in say Norway or Netherlands.\n\nA classmate from my master's degree went on to to become a postdoc with a biomedicine research group at Tampere University and he is planning to move next year because being in that research group is basically the most he can do in Finland with his degree. This is highly anecdotical of course.\n\nIf you simply like Finland because of the good quality of life then by all means give it a go, however, keep in mind that you might find yourself stuck in academia for the foreseeable future",

            "selftext": "So I called with some symptoms that can be serious almost three weeks ago and all I was told was to use some over the counter medicine from the pharmacy and wait. I was told to call again if it doesn't get well. When I call again when the symptoms did not improve this time it is a different nurse and I was told a different thing and use more medicine and wait more, then third call one more week after this nurse asked on the phone to a doctor and doctor said I was not supposed to use that medicine for that long and that high dose. I still haven't seen or talked to a doctor myself on face to face or on the phone. This what nurse asks to the doctor and says to me on the phone. \n\nNurses are not doctors and not knowledgable of what medicine to use and she tells me to use the maximum dose of several painkillers at the same time and the doctor says it shouldn't be used like that more than a few days and definitely not two weeks. Why are they able to give advice and wrong advice on the phone, not give any appointments to the doctor, which is the right person that patient supposed to be given medicine advice not a nurse, and of course they will not take any responsibilty if something goes wrong by going to the doctor too late. I asked the nurse that what will happen if it is too late when I see the doctor and if my problem is acute and asked if they take responsibility if my situation goes wrong because of they didn't give appointment and gave me wrong treatment she said they don't take responsibility.\n\nWho is the right person to complain about lack of quality in healthcare services? I asked this on the call to the nurse but she is not giving me any contact info to their superiors. How do I escelate this situation? I am sure there should be some complaint option. I am not the only person by the way, if you check their Google reviews you will see this healthcare center is just horrible.\n\nHere I am talking about absolute lack of quality. I lived in Finland for very long time so I know the public healthcare is not the best thing here but for example I remember at least a doctor's appointment is scheduled and the nurses didn't risk it with giving wrong treatments on the phone without even seeing the patient. \n\n\nI am talking about a really lacking service. Such as they are returning to callback requests several days later, they don't answer Maisa messages, one advice that one nurse gives contradicts with the next nurse gives on the phone few days after and also contradicts with the doctor when they talk with the doctor. I am not able to see a doctor in serious situations. They dismiss all my symptoms that can be serious things and say things like if there is no pain you don't need to see the doctor. This \"no responsibility taken if anything goes wrong\" attitude is just terrible. What is the right way and right person to complain to about this?\n\nAnd before you say about private healthcare. No I am not getting it. I paid taxes here 15 years and I at least deserve to see a doctor 2-3 times a year without paying for a private insurance.\n\nBy the way does anybody know if I go to the healthcare centre and take a queue number directly without dealing with phone do they have to give me service there?",

Surely, a broken bone might require an xray to be confirmed, but for an example, a possibly broken ribbone does not warrant an xray since they heal on their own and over the counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or NSAIDs should be sufficient to treat the pain. And yes, I work in the health care, and no, not in Helsinki or it's surroundings. It is amazing how parients or relatives act towards nurses, they tend to ask for a doctor, even just to confirm that their flu is just a flu and it should go away on it's own within a week or two. \n\nIf you wish to complain, please head over to https://www.hel.fi/en/health-and-social-services/data-and-the-rights-of-the-client/dissatisfaction-with-treatment-or-service\n\nAnd when it comes to the quality of healthcare in Finland, I've had people tell me that our healthcare is more advanced than many other countries in Europe for an example. Sure, like every other country, our healthcare system has it's flaw's and they are mostly related to things which you mentioned - difficulty to make an appointment, whether to see a doctor, a GP or a specialist doctor, a nurse, psychiatric nurse or any other e.g. And surely, the costs have a huge difference when comes to public and private health care - you pay an average of a 30-60 euros per a doctor visit and that includes laboratory tests, X-rays and all the given medicine, when it comes to public healthcare, but when we're talking about the private sector, we're talking about a 100 euro difference, and that only get's you to see a doctor, all the extras cost more, like aforementioned labs and xrays, for an example.",

And if you do have improvement ideas please the more reason to send them: https://www.hel.fi/en/health-and-social-services/data-and-the-rights-of-the-client/dissatisfaction-with-treatment-or-service\n\nWhen I first moved to Finland I had a similar experience and it was frustrating. However I now understand how it works and it doesn’t stress me as it used to. Again I don’t know if it is better or worse than in my country, and I wouldn’t know how to make the system better.\n\nNurses and doctors are humans like you and me. Humans make mistakes, and feedback is how we learn from mistakes.\n\nIn two different occasions (with two independent conditions but equally limiting to my quality of life) I had two completely different experiences with Helsinki healthcare. In one, the nurse searched for the right doctor for my condition and the doctor ensured I got the tests needed to diagnose and treat so that “I wouldn’t need to visit again for this condition” (his words, I guess it saves money if a patient is healed and stops using resources). In the other occasion, the nurse thought my problem would go away with burana and rest. It didn’t. It made it worse. I ended up having to use 10 more visits that could have been avoided if diagnosed and treated correctly in the first week. I don’t think they were a bad nurse, just an overworked one. Overworked humans make more mistakes, and politicians and coordinators should know this.\n\nI’m a firm believer that healthcare should never be a for-profit business as that would drive class separation further. It should be an investment we do as a civilized society. So I can understand why you don’t want to go to the private sector.\n\nI hope you find a resolution soon, best of luck!",

Very clever. Finland is very advanced wow wow oh my god. Other countries have a lot to learn from Finland!\n\n\"Immigrant from an undeveloped country supposed to be impressed when hearing these\". All 199 countries in world are all stupid and they use doctors with 6 years education and xrays but Finland is able to use nurses instead lmao. What a cope mechanism do you have there? I want one. Just kidding I hope nobody has that.\n\nIn Finland you cannot visit the urgent department during the hours 8-16. You cannot simply go to urgent department! You can only call it after 16.\n\nYou can call 112 but that is your only option and only for you are about to die. Hope they believe you are about to die.\n\nThen after that still you need to call and they will just dismiss your problems as unimportant just with \"phone diagnosis\" without seeing anything or taking any responsibility. \n\nThis is the condition of the healthcare in Hel right now. \n\nI will not doxx my real problem here because of privacy but I had this same issue also with a broken bone in Finland and took just as long.\n\nI am not coming from an undeveloped country and I am not that impressed with the Finnish healthcare. How about that? This seems to be of the quality of a war hospital in Africa, something definitely not Europe. In all the modern countries they have hospitals and you can visit there and see a doctor, on the same day! \n\nHave a nice coping!",

I don't know in which city you live in but now imagine you are not given an opportunity to talk with a doctor for three weeks, even talking with a nurse takes 2-3 days and they call at random times like at 21:30 in the evening. What kind of nonsense is this? You already passed that phase and talked with a doctor and then you got the wrong diagnosis. I am dealing with only nurses. \n\nYou have to use the nurse as intermediary. Here they don't give you appointments. They can ask like if you have too much pain and may just say you don't need to see doctor because you didn't say you had extreme pain.\n\nYou saw a doctor and you got an opinion from the doctor. I did not. In Helsinki the healthcare is completely non-functional right now, I know this because I moved from a different city to here.

Calling you own health center is the first line for simple things, guidance etc, which you have been doing. Then you stopped there and that is why your treatment is not going forward.\n\nIf things do not improve, SOMETIMES you book an appointment with the doctor. This is for things like long term chronic things. You need to understand, even if you did like they guided you, the nurse CAN\\_NOT\\_GIVE\\_YOU\\_AN\\_SPEEDY\\_APPOINTMENT\\_FOR\\_TODAY. There are appointment times for chronic things and then some (too little) for things that need a speedier resolve but that aren't acute in sense you are describing. That is simply not how it works here.\n\nIf your symptoms are acute (and could resolve while waiting for the long term doctors appointment, so no sense to book) you need to go to the urgent care. Times for when it is open are listed on the your own health care center's website. You absolutely can and should go there, take a number and wait in queue. Name of this service in finnish is akuuttivastaanotto. Go early in the morning, as soon as it opens. You will again see a nurse first. They sort people based on their illness severity and tell you to sit down. Then you wait, and you will be called by name and then you see the doctor. You get the exam, labs, X-rays etc that you are after.\n\nIf your symptoms cannot wait for the urgent care, you go to ER . Be prepared to be turned at the door, they do not treat cold or minor boohoos since it is for emergency only, or the wait there is abysmal since everyone else goes in front of you with emergency things.\n\nIf a layperson is confused where and what you should do (can this wait, should I go to X, what can I do to alleviate Y) outside your health care center working hours you can call the Päivystysapu 116117. Yet again, a  nurse will answer and recommend treatment at home or if you should wait till the urgent care opens in the morning or if you should come straight away to the ER or call an ambulance.\n\nHope this helps. Seeing as you are still alive after following recommendations you were in fact not too sick and didn't suffer from ER level stroke, heart attack, pulmonary embolism etc. Which is wonderful and proves that the system ranked your severity correctly.",

Meaning basically only people that don't have work or wealth (unemployed, children and elderly of lower economic status) go to terveyskeskus.\n\nThis is a really sad condition, but it is a reality now and will likely get worse due to increased public spending cuts. Not enough people work to pay off the public expenses, so everything public is being cut by the current right wing government.\n\nThe saddest thing about this all is that it was recently in the news that young people are depressed about having to go to work and are increasingly on sick leave due to mental health issues and even retirement of young people due to mental issues is increasing. This costs 12 billion euro per year for our country. This is equivalent to our entire yearly budget deficit!!\n\nSo they cut your medical services and save some maybe hundreds of millions, a ridiculously small amount in comparison.",

They could not speak or stand with their unbearable pain. When a layperson describes few weeks of unbearable pain, well... It just seems dramatic you know. Tell it to me in my own terms, how much is it from 0 to 10, 0 no pain and 10 worst possible unbearable pain? Is it constant or situational in some way, does it ever go away completely?\n\nHealthcare is not functioning as well as it should, I give you that. Knowing the system and having medical literacy helps to navigate it but a lot of people are stuck in weird loops and fall trough gaps. I have empathy for those with limitations such as language barrier. Older people are having tough time too getting trough. I do not mean your english is limiting factor, you have perfectly good english but the person on the other end might not have that and misunderstands you. Are you this defensive/aggressive IRL too? It might hinder your treatment.\n\nYou did not mention in your post that you have been to akuuttivastaanotto at all, that is why I  recommended doing that. If you have been there and were turned away I'm assuming they meant to call your health care center and book a time. Are you employed, are you covered by your employers plan? Without knowing more I can not help and should not help someone over reddit. I have not been there with you, you have heard what they said. Pain is for sure worrying and limiting symptom but rarely threatens life or limb. It is more of an chronic issue (since whatever progress that brought the pain did not kill you yet).\n\nI truly hope you get the help you need.",

You cannot establish anything over the phone unless it is a very clear symptom. Most of the cases a person might have one of several issues or all of them. This can only be known by in person check up or diagnosis with technology like tests, x-ray, CT etc. Not saying to take burana over the phone! In other countries healthcare professionals are not stupid and do all those tests. Because if something goes wrong they have to take responsibility. A simple call over the phone and saying take burana you are okay of course would not be enough and if something goes wrong it would be clear that they are doing malpractice and you don't need to court for this in many cases. There is functioning complaint systems. You can contact the head doctor at your hospital for example.",

No questions asked, no prescreening! \nThere is also clinics, family doctor etc. for more general things that you can make appointments. They never replace each other! \n\nThere might be an info desk but this is not for dismissing your problems. You are not told by a random different nurse \"take burana\", increase dose, increase more, add more pain killers and more for three weeks. \n\nA nurse is not a doctor period. They cannot plan your three weeks care and your medicine.  If so why do we need all these doctors? Let's make everyone a nurse and they tell people to go buy burana over the phone!! How can a normal person with normal mind can even defend this? People like you are really completely disconnected from reality in this country. It is really not even worth discussing with them! \n\n Nowhere in the world I know that you call and get dismissed. You go to an acute department and wait any day any time and see a doctor! \n\nSo I am sure again some super smart person from Finland would say only Finland is doing it correctly and all other countries are doing it wrong 🤣 🤣 \n\nEveryone knows that a diagnosis cannot be made over phone. How is this even legal in Finland? How? You are supposed to discuss how this is even legal! I know how because there are many loopholes like this that is illegal but somehow accepted as legal in Finland.\n\nWhile you supposed to say it is completely wrong to do it this way and we are wrong you act like this is the normal way!",

It is burdensome even to talk about it to people, because I don’t want to come across as needy. It is hard to describe what this is because it is a lived experience of expat life. People might just throw around some random advice like “it happens to everyone, it will go away once you make friends, blah blah blah…”. It seems almost impossible to make friends here simply because everyone seems they already have all the friends they ever gonna need. There is no easy way out and just a sad reality of an expat life not only in Finland, but have we ever stopped and thought what it really means and feels like to be the other person? Or maybe we just don’t have the time anymore and don’t want any trouble. ",

So, even the most extrovert people might have issues making friends in a different country. For example, it’s quite easy for me to make friends who share the same culture as me but with others it can be quite challenging.\n\nNow, let’s come to Finland. If we look at Finnish culture then people are more isolated themselves and it is a big culture shock for people who move from countries which have opposite culture. The thing is that even most of Finnish people have hard time making new friends. \n\nThen comes the age, it is quite easy to make friends in high school but when you are in a professional life things get difficult especially when most of your friends are married.\n\nWhen I first came to Finland things it was a huge culture shock for me but after 8 years here I think I learned a lot. I made a lot of Finnish friends and adapted to the culture. \n\nSo, first don’t blame yourself for not being able to make friends. That won’t do you any good. Try to find international people as they are usually more open to making new friends. If you are a student I would say universities are best places to make friends.\n\nLife is hard and it’s okay to complain but we should also figure out ways to fix things and accept that some things are not in our control so no point in panicking over them.",

Moreover, there is a good portion of population of the country that would rather have no immigrants. So try focusing on inner peace and close circle and do ask for medical help if it comes to it.

If you're a black American, you will still face racism but less than a black Kenyan. Muslims and non Muslim brown people face lots of racism too.\n\n\nFor example if you're from Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Somalia or Russian.. that could be an issue because unfortunately YLE news only shows the negative sides of those countries. And Finns only know negative things about them, and I wouldn't be surprised if many people actively avoid you because of that. While each of them is a beautiful country with rich heritage, Finns are rarely interested in those countries and many might think of you as an illiterate person who mistreats women, and is a Muslim extremist. It's stupid, racist and unfair but you can't change people's narrow minded view about things. I'm originally from one of them and my Finnish friends were surprised when I showed them big malls with western brands, Christmas celebrations (yes there are hundred thousands of christians there), pictures of mountains and skiing. In their minds my country was a desert and everyone was forced to wear hijab (which isn't true), and men hit women (happens unfortunately but still not the norm). I mean it isn't a prosperous place for living but it's not that horrible. Unfortunately, Finnish media actively pushes negative things about many countries to people's minds. And Finns act according to this agenda. \n\n\nI have dealt with shit ton loads of racism and exclusion in Finland. Some people don't give you a chance to prove yourself, instead they avoid you altogether. It's a sad life, but it's what it's. And if you speak up, they will gaslight you.  \n\n\nOf course, I'm not saying everyone is like that, there are very kind Finns. I hope you will meet them. But in general Finland is a rather isolated place and the environment breeds stereotypes. I have heard the same sentences from many people: \"Americans are fake\", \"Russians aren't trustworthy\", \"Somalis are leeches \", etc. Which are very sad to hear.  \n\n\nI'm very sorry that you're going through that, but please know that you're not alone. Your feelings are valid. I'm sending virtual hugs, and please message me if you want to chat or meet in person.",

I mean I know it’s much safer there and kids just do things independently, but that is one example of how I felt she was silently judging us. We are also a loud and outspoken family which was an adjustment for her. We learned that most Finns are introverts and keep most things private. Our family is the exact opposite. I can understand how coming from the Middle East where people greet you in the street and you enjoy dining with friends, it could be very isolating and lonely living in a country where people pretty much keep to themselves. Are there groups for other expats there? If there are not, could you start one? I think maybe meeting up with people from other countries who are more outgoing may make it easier to break in with the Finns.

It is not a strange land filled with humanoid beings who operate differently from you and me, despite the marketing there's still people who are worth befriending as well as those who simply aren't.\n\nPeople who are difficult for you to befriend probably aren't worth the trouble of befriending, despite some swearing they will be a \"friend for life\". If *both* parties don't take steps to get to know one another, I will assume you don't want to hang out and look for someone who does. That's just how it works everywhere in the world, and yes here too. For some it's personal issues (aka not your problem), for others it's shyness (aka not your problem), for some it's circumstances (ditto), some just don't want to be friends with *you* (aka... you get the picture). Why would you want to be friends with *them*, then? I've met people who straight up told me they don't want any new friends, so... I moved on and found those who do, and we're still friends to this day. Why be friends with weirdos?\n\nLastly, you don't know what other people are thinking and whether or not they appreciate you, especially if you're just a stranger to them. Some might think you're cool, to others you're just some guy or girl, and if you physically stand out as much as I do some might think you aren't even human and will tell you as such, especially if they're on something and feeling pissed off at the world. It's not worth wasting your energy on because it's their business what they think. As long as you're polite and nice to everyone first, it's not your fault. Thinking about this is a waste of your time.\n\nPeople who want to make new friends go to uni and work clubs and get-togethers, join a group sport like Pilates (though there too you can find the \"ew no I have friends already\" crew, simply ignore them) or rock climbing, Finnish classes are good too. Most of all it takes time, and if you're new it's normal to feel like this. If you're polite and nice it's not you, unpleasant people can exist all over the world. Best of luck.",

There’s nothing more satisfying than a good old moan to a Brit, so it’s especially heartening when anyone, Finns included, jump on that bandwagon. Especially as there’s so much to observe with slack jawed incredulity across the United Kingdom.\n\nUnfortunately, or perhaps more annoyingly for you, my perspective puts me in a good place to analyse Finnish behaviour from both an outsider and insider point of view. I probably have a better idea in several respects as to how Finns ‘operate’. I think maybe you’ve spent a few more minutes per day than is healthy here, and your world view has become narrowed and polarised.",

But I have a gut feeling you would not enjoy many of our typical ways to spend time. \n\n\nDuring winter we don't really \"horse around\", like go see shows, circus, shop 'till we drop, sit in a special cafe or bar, do every extreme hobby there is-- for 99% of the time. We'd rather spend quality time either indoors (cook/bake, knit, play games, read...) or outdoors (walk, bike, ski, ice skate...). Simple, \"boring\" everyday life. \n\n\n\n\nNature and the flow of seasons are big things in Nordic countries, one has to be comfortable with the fact that the sun sets at afternoon, and that it can be completely silent. For someone who isn't used to this, it can be uncomfortable, scary even. And of course some of us just need to burn off energy more than others- but what do you WANT to do? ",

Such practices are based on two erroneous premises: first, that sexual orientation and gender identity is necessarily a choice, the result of some esoteric evil power, or an outright disease, and second, that it can be suppressed, changed or cured.\"\n\nI kind of liked the term \"euro-crimes\" elsewhere in the text as well.

On the topic of banning conversion therapies, I think it's a social issue and not a legislative one and trying to make it such will backfire due to the rising neo-conservatism we see all around us. Petitioning for legislation to ban what at the end of the day is a bad opinion is not a good way to have a conversation on the topic. A more productive way would be to work to give people the strength to give the finger to people trying to convert anyone to anything.",

I don't think it should be the role of government to legislate what consenting adults do regarding their sexuality.\n\n\n\"Useless for their intended purpose\" is mostly true. afaik you can't turn from a homosexual into a heterosexual. However, if your purpose isn't exactly to turn into a heterosexual, but to just refrain from homosexual sex because you view it as sinful, I think that's achievable. A bisexual can focus on their attraction to the opposite sex and not act on their desires to the same sex. A homosexual can live in selibacy, if they so wish.\n\n\n\"Generally harmful\". Sure, in my moral paradigm it is harmful, but the people who willingly go to conversion therapy may see harm differently. They think that certain sexual activities are sinful and therefore harmful. Whereas getting help to not engage in such activities can save their immortal soul from damnation.\n\n\nI think cults in general are harmful, useless, and immoral but I wouldn't ban them. Many would argue sex work is harmful and morally dubious. Smoking is harmful, by being damaging to others it's also immoral, and it's useless. Same applies to some extend to drugs and alcohol. I think dating apps are morally dubious and harmful to some users. Gambling is harmful and also useless in the big picture. Cosmetic surgery is morally dubious, does obvious harm, meaning medical risks, and sometimes it's counterproductive. Circumcision of boys without medical indication is morally wrong, mostly useless and harmful.\n\n\nI'm not really against banning it. I just think \"A is evil and harmful, it should be illegal.\" Is simplistic, and there needs to be a broader conversation about the legal ramifications, the role of the state in people's private matters and religious freedom. If I could wave a magic wand and make tobacco, or non-medical circumcision, or conversion therapy disappear I would do so. But using the monopoly of violence of state to enforce such a ban is a more complicated matter.",

This is based on the principle that when a customer makes a purchase decision based on the price, they cannot be told at the checkout that they need to pay more. It's their mistake, not the customer's, so they must sell it at the lower price and then correct their error. However, in this case, where the tag says 0, I don't think the same rule applies because no one can reasonably assume that a product in a store would be free unless it specifically says \"free to take\" or \"free.\"",

If someone is or becomes disabled in Finland, they get all personal support (rehabilitation, devices, etc) from public healthcare and there is a lot of legal framework on the services available to disabled persons. Additionally, the place of work is adviced through occupational health care (which is mandatory for every employer to offer). The non-profit and governmental sectors are also active and have published for example free handbooks on how to remove barriers for disabled persons to work. I think the non-profit sector also offers councelling services on the matter.",

Mortgage on house 1500 e fully loaded.Got a car and fuel on that really depends. Car insurance covered by op bonuses, they amazing! Sometime fuel is 100 euro a month,sometimes its 200. Groceries around 800 euros with diapers, second kid being just on mommy milk and sometimes pilti.\nThat covers all our basic needs so 2500 salary would be enough to sustain the whole family, would not be fun though cause you sometimes have extra expenses and then you got no money. We going to my wife family to celebrate xmas - they all getting a twix bar as a present. 😅 Unemployed unfortunately",

And this type of net income also includes sporadic restaurant food, a vacation, kids’ hobbies etc. \n\nI can vouch for this personally. We live in the Helsinki area, have two kids and our joint costs are around 2500* euros/month (*our living costs are extremely low, so in that regard we’re not the average family). My gross income is 5700 euros/month.",

I save all the time so that in a tight spot I have resources, and am trying to save enough to be able to take kids for a vacation someday. It never happens though, there's always something that I have to use my savings for. It's really frustrating. \n\nBut, to be really comfortable, I think that 3000 would be enough for us.",

Every single sauna will have rocks on the stove, and pretty much most of saunas will be made of wood. Are you saying it's electric? While that might not be *the* most authentic experience, it certainly is simpler and still is a great sauna experience. Its also actually  somewhat difficult to find a wood fired sauna experience as a tourist, since even most Finns' personal sauna's are electric now.",

Turn your electric sauna on. If you are not sure how it is done, read instructions in hut or call land lord and ask. You now need to wait 40 minutes-1 hour untill sauna is hot. While waiting that: \n\n2. Go local supermarket and buy for children Hartwall Omena sodas and yourself either same sodas, or beer or long drink. Also buy sausages (lenkkimakkara or grillimakkara of your choice) and Auran sinappi mustard tube (medium).\n\n  \n3. Put drinks to fridge to cool. Sometimes finns cook sauna sausage over sauna stove in tinfoil, but since it is rental hut and electric sauna you will do them in oven. Put sausage in oven proof pan and put them into fridge to wait.\n\n4. Go check if sauna is ready. There is a thermometer on the wall showing temperatures. When it is 70-80c, sauna is ready to use.\n\n5. When sauna is ready, undress (naked), shower quickly and go in sauna with your family. Take bucket of water with scoop you. Everyone sits on benches. If someone feels it is too hot they can sit on lower bench. Throw water to stove, just a little bit first (about 1 dl) to get the feel. \n\n6. When someone feels too hot, they can go to take another shower or if you are on peacefull place, cool down outside a bit. You can repeat sitting in the hot room and going out to cool as many times you like. You can grab now cool drinks from fridge and have some while cooling down. \n\n7. This point (when it starts to feel you can't repeat sauna much longer) put sausages in the oven, 200c.\n\n8. At the end everyone will properly wash themselves and leave sauna, wrapped in towels. Last one leaving hot room turns sauna OFF. Rinse benches with water and close sauna door, so after heat will dry the hot room.\n\n9. Sausages should be ready now. Everyone eats together some sauna sausage with mustard, still wrapped in towels or wearing pyjamas. Talk about your day and how everyone is doing.",

Some months i worked 60+hrs/week for the whole month and sometimes just 25. \n The lady in the appointment told me they require you to have 4years with A visa only and doesnt matter about the contract.

They are just another mediocre online shop, they try to cut corners by optimizing everything (but not really well at least not from the customers point of view). Which means, it's not a scam, but they have inconsistent stock, long delivery times etc... do look at the trustpilot revies.\n\nAs for the price of the backpack: that's not especially cheap. This is a bit opinionated, but by buying any Fjällräven Kånken, you are paying for the brand mainly and not that much of quality or design. I.e. they are a bit overpriced, they probably have a lot of margin for profit in their price; they are really similar to any other backpack made for cheap.\n\nThe 32€ you are seeing here is probably just the price minus the \"brand fee\"; they are probably selling an old model or very small surplus stock here for cheaper than usual.\n\nSo, my recommendation is: if you like the backpack, then order it.",

I don't know if they have apartments in Uusimaa though.   \nI would not apply for city housing. It takes waaay too much time to get even an answer. So a few months to even years to wait for city housing.",

                    "body": "But hey, I asked chatGPT what I could do to save money in an inflation time when I live paycheck-to-paycheck and it had some good suggestions!\n\nHere are a few feasible ones for anyone:\n\n* **Track Your Spending**: Start by tracking where your money goes each month. (Nordea netbank has a pretty good built in feature for this budgetting!)\n* **Prioritize Essentials**: Focus on spending for essentials first (housing, utilities, food) and then move on to non-essentials. Finding ways to reduce these essentials, such as cooking at home more often or negotiating bills, can free up more money.\n* **Create an Emergency Fund**: Even if it’s just a small amount each month, aim to build an emergency fund. This provides a safety net that can prevent stress when unexpected expenses pop up. (5-10 euros a month that you don't touch is some rainy day money, right?)\n* **Use Coupons/Discounts**: Whether for groceries, clothing, or other purchases, there are often deals available. Using cashback apps, shopping during sales, or getting loyalty rewards can add up over time. I have all the apps: S-etukortti, Lidl Club card, K-Plussa kortti. You find some awesome deals and the last two were just an app to download! S-kortti you need to go to the s-bank but it should also be otherwise quite easy. \n* **Automate Savings**: Set up an automatic transfer to a savings account, even if it’s just a small percentage of your paycheck. This can help you build savings without thinking about it. I have an investment account that I use for this. If I have some extra money, I put it there. If not, then whatever, it grows (or shrinks!!) on its own. \n* **Review Subscriptions**: Take a look at all your subscriptions (streaming services, memberships, apps, etc.). Cancel those you don’t use regularly. I realized I had a photo editing app for 12 eu a month that I wasnt paying attention to. I mean, that is 144 at the end of the year I can use, for example, in my investment account!",

But I just wanted to check if anybody has gone through this before.\n\nSome more info: This computer will mostly be used for Adobe products, Photoshop / Lightroom etc... so my biggest concern is the muscle memory for remembering keyboard shortcuts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lbw1punx83e1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed488b2d360d6a1ba55edca9a9c9504999b9f466\n\nedit: added the photo  \n",

                    "body": "Agreed. However sometimes people go into a PhD program because they don't know what else to do and end up figuring out during the program that it is something outside of academia. I've heard from a lot of people that they really didn't like the culture/atmosphere/etc. in that world and decided to go in a different direction. However, most of why I have such a view of academia is probably because I've mostly talked with people who decided to leave and not with many who decided to stay.\n\nBut anyway, most things in life do not require a doctorate so it's not something that most people seriously consider. And many who do consider it, also have other options which only require a master's degree and which might make more sense in several ways. So a postgrad program can be quite a hard sell for many people. If more people are needed in those programs, the people in charge should seriously evaluate what needs to be changed to accomplish that.",

Is \"soft locking\" a person into debt really accountability on the part of the student? \n\nRich kids can have their daddies pay for expenses as they arise, thus avoiding having to pay interest fees forced upon the students who have to take the loan to survive. This in turn means that those who have money already have to pay a pretty sizable chunk less for the time they spend studying.\n\nIn addition, financial insecurity is a major factor on whether people decide to have kids. I'm not saying living for \"free\" would solve the falling birthrates in Finland, but increasing financial stress of those who are \"at the best age to have children\", I can't see that helping the issue.",

Summer is a safe bet, but winter test isn't that bad, and in my case, it offers some advantages, too.\n\nThe first topic is that the speed limit will be lower in winter (e.g. on the highway), and your situational speed can be even lower. \"Have-to\" slow driving would significantly benefit traffic processing and reaction time. \n\nNext are the unique difficulties you might meet in the winter driving test:\n\n\\- Slippery: It depends heavily on the weather. Black ice is nasty, but thin snow on the road is manageable (I barely got slippery in daily winter driving with studded tires). Pay attention to the car alignment, and with enough practice, you can notice when the car starts to slide based on the car's central mass shifting out.  \nWhat are dangerous occasions for being slippery? When merging and exiting the highway (any lane changing at high speed), I recommend practicing soft (yet decisive) lane changing.\n\n\\- Cannot see the road line: I applied with what I was taught: take the right lane if there's no need for other lane, and use the road sign to fine the correct lane at upcoming junction.\n\n\\- Poor visibility: Pay extra attention to the road sign to identify pedestrian crossing (as the zebra cross isn't visible due to snow).\n\nIt took me 3 attempts to pass the driving test, and the test that I passed, I performed splendidly with no error at all. That was thanks to the intense reflection and preparation before the test. \n\nOnce, I failed due to not yielding when performing a left turn at a traffic light junction without arrow lights. I then practice my situation awareness and decision-making by having ChatGPT generate simulated traffic situations, and I simulate the situations and my decisions in my head before replying to its questions.  \nAnother time I failed due to unsafe driving in urban area. I addressed the shortcoming by taking light jogs to various residential areas, pay attention to road signs, equal junctions, pedestrian crossings, emulated in my head what would be my decision when driving toward them.\n\nIt's reasonable to develop fears from failing the driving test (considering the invested effort and financial that don't yield a favorable outcome). Nevertheless, I would encourage prepare the mindset to embrace the failing, and the mental pressure get so much more manageable.   \nIn my case, \"I am glad I failed the test so that I can learn about the problem I caused and not endanger others when I hold the license in the future\".   \nTo my surprise, such a simple act would improve my driving ability to an extend that I didn't expect.\n\nAll the best with your journey!",

I know a lot of people have posted about making friends in this sub Reddit. But mine is different, it is about keeping friends.\n\nI'm just sharing my experience: I'm originally from Lebanon and I have lived in Finland for 9 years. I do speak Finnish fluently (with some small accent).\n\nOver the years, I have put lots of effort in knowing different people here, some were men while others were women (not dating). However, I have noticed a pattern of coldness, aloofness and withdrawal in almost all of them.\n\nFor example, I met them with lots of enthusiasm, kindness and supported them through their journey for years. We studied and worked together, I invited them and they invited me over, etc. We went to bars together and celebrated birthday parties, etc. However, overtime almost all of those just faded away and the friendships just vanished! Each year some person is gone or I'm blocked by one. It is really strange, while some didn't block me, but very rarely send a text message and only answer in a few days when I send them a message first.\n\nThis is very bizarre, because nothing bad happened between us nor we had any disagreements. I can't think of anything that could cause this tension, like we don't discuss about politics or sensitive topics. What makes it even weirder: those people don't know each other, it is not like they decided to end the friendship with me.\n\nI'm now seriously wondering if people in Finland care about friendships? Or is everyone so individualistic and only thinks about themselves first?\n\nDid anybody else go through that? Did people change because of technology or... ? It is so unreal.",

Here we tend to value individuals ability for survive with minimun contact or burdening of other people. After a while, living with minimal social contact starts to feel natural and everything more than that just complicates everyday life.\n\nSecond, as progressive nation we have adopted quite quickly the western individualism.\n\nThird, it could be very well just age thing.

The problem for those coming into Finland is that they are often late into the process.\n\nFor example, I have lived away from Finland for some 25 years now but I grew up there and went to school there. I could easily go back, and I do, and see family and friends from my childhood, and although we're all older and have families now it's always easy to arrange a catch up. If I was to move back and to try and make new friends, especially if it wasn't in my hometown? Well, that'd be a slower process.\n\nAll of this is magnified if you come from a smaller place.\n\nIt's hard for someone from a more social culture to acclimatise to the slower pace of social relationships.",

So, while it's not necessarily rooted in racism, the fact that your being different cultural background play a part in the equation can not be fully dismissed.\n\n\nThat being said, I both been left by friends and left people I once considered to be friends behind through various phases in my life. I believe that this is part of the natural evolution of human relationships.\n\n\nAfter all, things happen in people's lives that will make it necessary for them to focus more time and attention on other things than actively maintaining a friendship with you. Not immediately responding to messages is part and parcel of Dealing with Life. If I'm cleaning up after an \"accident\" that a child has had or am busy cooking a family dinner I won't be getting right back to my friend who's shared a photo of their turtle. By the time dinners ready, the kid or kids have eaten and the household has quieted down I might be too tired or even, for the moment have forgotten about the turtle photo. The next morning I might have an important early work call and while I still liked the fact that you shared a photo with me, as time passes I find it more and more difficult to put together a nice response.\n\n\nI think many Finns tend to have friends, real friends, that they don't communicate with actively every day, week or even month. In fact, for some even years will pass with only birthday and Christmas messages back bad forth, some skipped, only for there to all of a sudden be a wedding invitation in the mail, to your old address. You'll go, partially to be polite but also to finally catch up with your dear friend whom you've thought about but not truly contacted for a couple of years.\n\n\nThere's also the other end of the spectrum with groups of friends who chat daily or at least weekly and then once a month go out for Sunday brunches or play street hockey on the winter and field football on the summer.\n\n\nUltimately, as long as you're not actively hurting each other, there's no truly right or wrong way to be friends. Rather, it's up to you and your friends to decide and to set boundaries and schedules that respects everyone's life situations as best as possible.",

The apartment numbers often don't repeat though, so there can't be an A 13 and a B 13 at the same street number. The entrance letter / designation is simply there to save some headache.\n\nSo in this case it's Mäkelänkatu street, house number 25, entrance B, apartment number 13.\n\nIn case of detached houses (omakotitalo), it's often just the street name with the number. If there are two or more houses on the same plot, they are designated A, B, C etc. no apartment numbers will be present. same goes for row houses.",

They're made of quality materials and have quite high necks or collars (whatever it's called), so snow doesn't get in as easily. Suggest you get a size just a tad too big, so you can fit proper thick socks under. They can still be tightened pretty well so they stay secure if you're wearing them with normal socks, even if they are half a size too big.",

I looked all over the internet and I am having trouble coming up with such things. If anyone here knows a place that shares their support for the Sami people, I would be seriously grateful. ",

Checked a few Lapland-themed restaurant websites and found no mention of the Sami. The only explicitly Sami restaurants I could find were located in the Sapmi area in the far north. \n\nHaving reindeer meat from Finnish Lapland on the menu doesn’t really tell you anything definitive, since the reindeer herders who the meat comes from can be either Sami or Finns ethnically (However, I believe that at least in Norway, and maybe also in Sweden, reindeer herding is only reserved for the Sami people, so perhaps a Norwegian reindeer origin can be a sort of quarantee of Sami origins?). And since most of the people living in the modern-day Lapland are not Sami, the odds are that even if the owners of the Lapland-style restaurants are from Lapland (which is not necessarily the case),  they are probably Finns rather than Sami. Would love to know however if there’s some authentic Sami restaurants in Helsinki. This is quite interesting, it’s cool that you’re researching this topic.",

Finland gets a large percentage of its power from nuclear energy and I think it would be really cool to move there and potentially work at one of these plants. If anyone knows anything about this I'd greatly appreciate it.",

For example Platom in Mikkeli specialices in nuclear engineering and AFRY is a bigger consult company with nuclear department in it.\n\nVTT research has some more academic jobs in nucleat field.",

Fortum also has an office in Espoo where they have lots of engineers and other office functions.\n\nWorth noting is also that in Olkiluoto there’s also Posiva’s final repository of spent nuclear fuel, which is currently in the final test runs before actual operation. I believe TVO has also an office in Helsinki, but it’s just for nuclear fuel procurement if I recall correctly.\n\nBesides actual NPP sites, we have an SMR startup called Steady Energy, which has a number of nuclear industry veterans behind it. Then there’s also VTT, Technical Research Centre of Finland, which does research at least on nuclear safety, SMRs and fusion. There’s also STUK, which is the Radiation and Safety Authority of Finland, and Platom, which is a smaller company specialized in different needs and services in the nuclear field.\n\nI’d say your best bet might be at the Fortum headquarters in Espoo, as they hire foreigners also. VTT also hires foreign people, but skews more on the doctoral level of education when hiring people. In Olkiluoto you also could have chance to get hired, but as the OL3 reactor is in operation there’s less and less foreign people working at site.\n\nIf Finland is not a must, I’d recommend considering Sweden also. They have multiple operational powerplants across the country, many reactors undergoing decommission, SKB is starting to build their final repository for spent fuel, Westinghouse is operating a nuclear fuel factory there, and there are also talks of new-built full scale nuclear power reactors. It’s easier language for foreigners to learn and Swedes are a bit more liberal in hiring foreigners.",

I have electric underfloor heating and I turn it on all the time. The rest of the floor dries fine except for this tile. I suspect there is no heating under this tile because it is in the corner.  There is waterproofing and water doesn't leak further, but just stays under the tile. When I dry with a hair dryer, water appears again from under the tile after a couple of minutes.\n\nTaloyhtiö is not helpful so far. They inspected it visually and concluded that it's a surface issue and we should look into it ourselves. Have you had similar experience? Do you have a good recommendation for a company that could handle this? Thanks for any suggestions.",

Most likely it's only a cosmetic issue, you kinda have to assume that the waterproofing is intact. You could get that fixed but it would obviously require removing a few tiles and mortar but that would be risky, it's very easy to damage the waterproofing and fixing that would lead to re-doing the whole bathroom (if done properly).\n\nI would say leave it 24 hours and see if it dries up.

Like if you are identified by hetu which is now removed as an identifier then bills start floating in imaginary space and it can break whole financial side of the system.\n\nAlso when customer ends contract personal information should disappear from the system within 1-2 years. There isn't leagal reason to keep that information. But companies need to store financial information 5 years. If billing is tightly coupled with hetu then that system will break.\n\nTry to get financial information from past 5 years if some bills are missing because hetu isn't there?\n\nCustomer identifier shouldn't be hetu, never.\n\nLegally name and birth date should be enough for gym membership. Only healthcare, loans, legal stuff, buying property etc. requires your hetu.\n\nYou can even buy a house and a car using shell company to avoid using your hetu. Bit paranoid but doable.",

            "selftext": "Hello folks. I was in Helsinki many years ago and a pint of beer (standard lager) was at that time way more expensive than London. Through my hazy memory, at that time it would have been about £4-5 a pint in London and probably €7-8 in Helsinki.\n\nI'm likely coming back to Helsinki early next year. London is now averaging about €7-8 a pint itself, but a quick search of cost of living sites like Expatistan suggests there hasn't been as much of a price jump in Finland. Is that true? Is it still about €8 a pint?\n\nCheers!",

Or if he doesn’t, do the Kela benefits get affected? \n\n- How effective are the studies in terms of getting a job - does the completion of the program suffice being on the resume? \n\n- What are the prospective job profiles/ companies that one can get into through the program? \n\nTIA!

Only student-related benefits from Kela are affected if you reject a study place. \n\nGetting a job in Finland is difficult, if you don't speak Finnish. Business degrees, while valued, are very common in Finland, and you'll be competing with native Finnish speakers in the job market. The Finnish job market is also in shambles right now, limiting your chances even more. It took me some 6 months to find an internship, and was forced to take an unpaid one, in order to still be able to graduate on time.",

After all I paid all my life into it. Except it's a pyramid scheme and I paid more into it than ill get out of it while older people paid less than what they are getting out of it.\n\nThis whole system is so rotten. I wish I could just opt out and invest the money my own way.",

Husbands had the larger savings and pensions. Taling away the kansaneläke för these women mean that they are 100% dependent on their husbands, or if husband is deceased, they loose their only income and forced to move back to Finland. 🇫🇮 \n\nWhile I think that the whole system is a scam after the Lama borrowings, taking away the remaining pension for these folks are not going to benefit anyone. \n\nPay off the debts are better solutions. Finland is now paying as much in interest only on our external debt than what we paid interest and mortgage before the pandemic. We are soon in the same boat as Greece was if this spending continues unstopped. Finland has already gotten world highest tax stress on their citizens and still debt is growing.",

Meanwhile, [Orpo did already last year give himself (and other wealthy people) a tax break](https://yle-fi.translate.goog/a/74-20051085?_x_tr_sl=fi&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp). \n\nI'm just wondering if this 43.3 million matters that much for a country set to take about **14.4 billion** in loans this year. The kansaneläke saving is so small it doesn't even register in the decimal. \n\nIf we need to save money, that's alright. But how about we start with the ones that have more money, instead of the ones that don't.",

I want to travel all over the world in my lifetime and I plan to move to Europe this June once I graduate high school. I am trying to save money and get an apartment where I can bring my dog, and I already want a job lined up when I move. I’ll get a visa and all that to move, and learn whatever language I have to as long as I know where I am going to be. Considering all of the conflict in Russia, I am looking for a country that will be safe if conflict heightens. I also want a place that will be easy to get a job while owning a dog. The countries I am currently considering include Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Finland, Georgia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. They each have pros and cons but considering everything I said does anyone have any ideas? Thanks",

The winter versions are warm and waterproof and the sole has good pattern for traction. The sole also allows good foot movement which I stongly prefer over overly stiff soles.\n\nThey are not BIFL quality, but I like to change the style every few years anyway. Current ones are going on their 4th year I think and are still in excellent condition.",

                    "body": "Harmonizing with u/SlummiPorvari\n\nUnfortunately soooooo much of the info on the net in my industry is deceptive and lacking nuance:\n\nPeople and articles repeat that leather comes in these specific grades: genuine, top grain and full grain.\n\nBut it’s simply not true terms are inclusive...all leather is genuine, everything that's not suede is top grain and full grain is unsanded top grain.\n\nIt annoys me immensely that all the articles call these terms \"grades\" because most people think of ***grading as taking objective measures that would be the same regardless of the source:*** The purity of metals, amount of marbling in beef, octane in gas, etc...but leather quality and price is going to vary by tannery more than these factors and there are thousands of tanneries all over the world. Those terms talk about what is or isn't done to a leather's surface mechanically (splitting and sanding), nothing more.\n\nIf you're saying \"genuine\" specifically means a bad low quality leather then I'm sure you've seen the other side of that coin: \"full grain is the absolute best/the highest grade\"\n\nBoth of those things are 100% false. Cheap crappy full grain exists...and there are products stamped \"genuine leather\" made with high quality full grain.\n\n**Exhibit A**: SB Foot Tannery is the largest by volume tannery in the USA they are full owned by Red Wing Boots and they use \"Genuine leather\" to refer generally to all their leather, even those that are explicitly full grain like Featherstone: [https://imgur.com/a/Tdtbjge](https://imgur.com/a/Tdtbjge)\n\n**Exhibit B**: Horween tannery in Chicago is probably the most \"famous\" tannery in the world...just search \"Horween\" on  or . This is Horween's explanation: [https://www.thetanneryrow.com/leather101/understanding-leather-grains](https://www.thetanneryrow.com/leather101/understanding-leather-grains)\n\nLeather quality is much more nuanced than terms like genuine, top grain and full grain can tell you... there are hundreds of other factors that go into tanning \"good leather\"...it's a bit like judging some that has many components, like a computer, by one factor and nothing else. What would would happen if you just maxed out one component and left the rest at the lowest level? Ram, hard drive space, the CPU, the GPU, monitor, type of hard drive and dozens of other things come together to make a good machine...the same is true with good leather.\n\nYou can view the Full Grain>Top Grain>Genuine hierarchy as a \"quick and dirty\" way to pick quality if you're in a hurry and not spending a lot of cash on a leather item.\n\nHowever, those terms do have actual meanings that don't always equate to good quality:\n\n**Full Grain** is a leather that has only had the hair removed and hasn't been sanded (corrected).\n\n**Top Grain** is actually a term that includes full grain: It's everything that's not suede a split, this means that full grain is a type of top grain. When you see \"top grain\" in a product description chances are it's a leather that's been corrected (sanded). Nubuck is an example of a sanded leather (often used on the interior of watch straps and construction boots because it's more resilient to scratches), but so is a much beloved leather: Horween's Chromexcel (it's lightly corrected). The amount of correction can vary widely but once the sander hits it, it's no longer full grain.\n\n**Genuine Leather** is, admittedly a term found on lots of low quality leather. That's because the bar for \"genuine\" is extremely low: It just means real. To a tannery it's all genuine. When you read the description for \"genuine\" that many online articles give, they're actually describing a leather called a \"finished split\", which is a usually cheap quality suede that's been painted or coated to look like smooth leather.\n\nPut simply:\n\nGenuine=Not fake\n\nTop Grain=Not a split\n\nFull Grain=Not sanded\n\nAnything beyond that is an assumption.\n\nThe gold standard for getting good leather is tannery and tannage...everything else is easily exploited by meeting the minimum definition of each",

Or order directly but youll need to make sure what the return policy is. Im sure if you gave them a call theyd help you out to get you the best fitting. If you end up buying do share your experience. :)\n\n\nedit. Lol found the tape… my foot measures at around 273.",

Yes, I got a replacement by mail almost immediately, but after several years of very mild usage (maybe 100 times of wearing) - the leather in the lacing points just ripped off.

Especially beautiful in Lapland, usually second week of September is good choice (give or take week or two). No tourists, amazing fall colours and if you are lucky you can see northern lights. If you are unlucky it will rain, but still be beautiful.\n\nDecember - Christmas time! Small shops, markets and other activities open in December in many cities. This can be magical time if you travel north. Southern parts may or may not have snow.\n\nJanuary - February, the best winter months if you are into winter activities. A lot of tourists in northern parts.\n\nMay - Spring time! Not something I would really recommend to tourists, but one of my personal favorite seasons. Nature comes back to life, cherry trees bloom and its off season so not so many tourists around for authentic experience.",

Now, second year seems substantially different, more blue and bleak. I find myself more lazy with a brain fog and somehow paralyzed to do anything. This creates a feedback loop where I feel guilty about not doing much which strengthens the loop. How does an average Finn and other people here go through this period? For sure, I am aware of the typical answer of “going to the gym and exercising…”",

Getting out the soft blankets and woolen socks and cozy, comfy jumpers, and putting on quiet, relaxing music, and just generally making the house super cozy is great.  Also opening the windows and airing things out every day is important.  \n  \nReading lots of books from the library.  \n\nMaking sure you have the correct clothing and footwear (hello, granny spikes) for cold weather so that going outside isn't miserable (this one is important).  That way you can go on walks and stay cozy and upright, and then come back to your cozy house.\n\nAlso, winter walks in the forest are amazing. Even in the dark, everything is quiet and still.  Even better if you can get cozy by a grilling place and grill some makkara.\n\nAlso of course, sauna and winter swimming are the best in winter.\n\nYou can also use the time in winter  to learn new things or practice things that you're interested in, like a language, an instrument, or drawing or writing.\n\nThere are also a lot of adult education classes you can take which will get you out of the house and socialising.\n\nIf you're in a bigger city, museums, the cinema, and the ballet or symphony can be really nice to attend in winter, too.",

Tell your neghbour that you did eran more then he did. That though is like Pandora's box.  Neighbour will be out for you, forever.",

Nothing else is expected of you. And even if you're not doing all of that, try not to be so hard on yourself. Get out of your own way.\nOne day, when you manage to get up out of bed, take a shower.

Does wonders for my mood.\n\n  \nWe have super-sensitive smoke detectors in our building and therefore can't have candles, but plop some LED candles into colored lanterns and you won't know the difference.\n\n  \n(I just prepared my \"Christmas table\" (actually just the living room table) this morning! Instead of all the other stuff that usually accumulates there, I now have an Advent wreath, my teeny tiny Murano glass Christmas tree (though considering what I paid for it, it's never been anywhere *near* the actual island of Murano), and my two Advent calendars (the obligatory Fazer chocolate calendar and the Prescott cocoa calendar). Maybe I'll add something over the next weeks; bottle of glögi or a new book as a Christmas gift from me to me. Can you tell I'm single?)\n\n  \nYou can find instructions for making various seasonally appropriate room sprays from essential oils online. This is nice for people like me in two ways; cookie scent (mandarin, almond, vanilla, aniseed, etc.) without having to bake (much), and Christmas tree scent (pine/fir) without having to deal with all those nice, natural needles all over the living room carpet.\n\n  \nAnd, oh, yes, physical warmth. Blankets, wollen socks, woollen sweaters, woollen shawls, what have you. Really no need to be shy about using a hot water bottle either, even if you *think* you could do without one; embrace the coziness. This is also the time of year when I dust off the ol' thermos bottle, because waking up in the middle of the night and being able to have some hot tea right away is *nice*.\n\n  \nAlso, ALL THE casseroles and stews ❤️ (I even have a recipe for glögi lasagna).\n\n  \nNature walks are great too, especially when there's snow. Even if you don't live on the outskirts of a town or in the actual countryside, there should be a park nearby.\n\n  \nOh, and thank you for the reminder to get new spikes for my boots... and maybe this year I'll finally remember to get a spike for my cane too...",

Not that much price difference between the two for vitamin supplements in my experience.\n\nEdit: One should note that not all of these Möller products contain vitamin D, and the ones that do don't contain that much of it. For example the recommended dose of Möller Tupla gives you 15-22.5 µg of vitamin D, and while that meets the Recommended Daily Intake of 20 µg, you may want to get more than that in the form of a separate vitamin D supplement. There's research that suggests that the RDI for vitamin D is often underestimated, and because vitamin D is water-soluble you cannot really overdose on it\\*. Personally I aim for 50 µg per day, because I get virtually zero sun in the winter months.\n\n\\* it's still possible, but you have to *really* try.",

Do NOT try to let the air out yourself if you have no previous experience, you may end up causing water damage. The maintenance people can check this.\n\n\nIt is also possible that the thermostats or valves on the radiators are stuck. Again, maintenance should know how to check for this.\n\n\nIf you have a big cold window, having thick curtains in front of it can really help. BUT the curtains must not block the radiators (especially the thermostats).\n\n\nAs others already advised, use insulation strips and wide painters tape to block the air leaks in the door if you can't get the maintenance people to repair the door.\n\n\nAsk neighbours if their apartments are cold too. If not, you can use that to argue that you have the right to a normal warm apartment just like the other inhabitants. If their apartments are also cold, you can try together to het maintenance to boost the temperature of the radiator network.\n\n\nIn the meantime, you could use one of those blankets that heat up when you plug them in. I have one at home and love to use it while watching tv or to heat up the bed before going to sleep (never put it under covers unless that is specifically allowed in the instructions of the model you are using). These do not use nearly as much electricity as an electric radiator and feel really amazing if you have e.g. cold toes.",

The level varies by individuals.\n\nThere is no such thing as Finnish English.\n\n\nNo need to worry though, especially in the bigger cities many people know how to speak English, and you probably have a translator app to help you. In Helsinki, many places offer service only in English. \n\nCool that you are studying Finnish, I'm sure people will be more interested to help you if you approach them with a \"Anteeksi, osaatko englantia, voitko auttaa minua\" rather than only speaking English.",

They used sampling so it's probably not a case of self-selection bias.\n\nSomething I did note was that for the top 5 countries (FI, SW, DK, NL and LU) all testing was done exclusively through \"computer-assisted web-based interviewing\" (CAWI) - so a questionnaire I'm guessing. These were the only countries where this was the case. I'm not sure what that means but it does strike me as a little odd that the countries that exclusively used this method are also the ones lighting up like a Christmas tree.\n\n[https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra\\_uploads/eu-gender\\_based\\_violence\\_survey\\_key\\_results.pdf](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/eu-gender_based_violence_survey_key_results.pdf)",

This is basically equating \"I will slap you, stupid!\" with SA. \n\nThis is why I NEVER trust any \"study\" that has a feminist narrative to it nowadays. It's always deliberately obfuscating and manipulating the data to fit a predetermined narrative that women are in horrible danger 24/7. Fear-mongering and sowing division. \n\n The worst one of these I've read was a 2023 UN study about Feminicide. That was making it seem women were being killed more than men due to their gender, but it obfuscated the male numbers by not telling them and only showed female numbers and percentages. But you could calculate the male portions from them yourself and men were killed like twice the amount than women. But it then says \"we can't confirm if these homicides were gender-based\" but it treats every female homicide as gender-based death. It's absolutely vile statistical lying. And I've seen people use highlighted screenshots as a \"gotcha\" to make a feminist talking point from that shit.",

What are the main characteristics of CAWI when used for the EU-GBV?**\n\n>Given the sensitive nature of the survey, respondents may be more willing to respond if there is no interviewer present. Moreover, CAWI is more flexible as regards the time and place for answering the questions.\n\n>However, although CAWI allows privacy in one sense, it is impossible to assess whether the respondent answers the questions with others present, and whether other people influence the responses. More importantly, using CAWI may exacerbate the risk of violence, as electronic communications can leave a trail; a perpetrator could discover that the respondent had shared her/his experiences of violence. ***Pilot surveys also showed that CAWI’s main weakness is the large number of non-responses***. Additionally, where complex questions are involved, the absence of an interviewer who could clarify the meaning of unclear questions or terms could result in illogical, incorrect or missing answers.\n\nIt seems the CAWI method has a large number of non-responses, meaning it does have a self-selection baked into it. That could explain how CAWI based responses are warping the final results. \n\nSource: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/13484289/KS-GQ-21-009-EN-N.pdf/1478786c-5fb3-fe31-d759-7bbe0e9066ad?t=1633004533458](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/13484289/KS-GQ-21-009-EN-N.pdf/1478786c-5fb3-fe31-d759-7bbe0e9066ad?t=1633004533458)",

Maybe not \"happens in every gathering\" common or \"it has to be you or your bestie\" common but I wouldn't call half of population having experienced incident (or several) a reach. And I could definitely see how being interviewed could limit the time you have to actually really think about question and include the instances that seem minor enough or that you'd like forget / mostly forgot about. Because even when there's no real time limit people don't take minutes staring at the interviewer trying to think about difficult question way they do with computer or interviewer might even interrupt it asking if you just didn't understand the question. Additionally you feel more pressure to put things positive when you are talking with real human being even if question is perfectly clinical and nobody interrupts your thinking.",

I need a little help here : \n\n1: I wonder what's the best brand that makes the best possible sunglasses ( especially the lenses)?\n2: should I specifically go with already made sunglasses ( I mean already sunglasses lenses instead) even tho I am going with a prescription sunglasses. Or I can just look for any frame and get it to sunglasses? \n\nLast question maybe a little tricky. I mean for example I was now looking at Maui Jim sunglasses but I don't really like their frames mostly sporty looking, even from what I have find so far they make one of the best sunglasses lenses. So I was like why not find any different frame from the shop that I may like and send it to Maui Jim for lenses. In case I decided to go with the Maui Jim. Plz give me a hand with this. I have never had prescription sunglasses or any good quality or brand sunglasses. So the picture not so clear to me. And if I go to store and start asking maybe I won't get the best advice there. \n\nAlso if you know any good optician they may know better or have best sunglasses I may give them a visit ( Uusimaa) it's just Synsam they will give me a big discount as a student.

I would love to hear your thoughts about this area.\n\nThe reason I ask is that I’ve come across several comments describing Pasila as an unattractive area. However, from what I’ve seen, Ilmala seems quite nice, especially with its proximity to the Central Park (Keskuspuisto).\n\nThank you in advance for your insights!",

Assuming you have, the next step is to look a) whether the place you would be renting is comfortable for you and b) what the area is like.\n\nEdit to add: What I mean that if you're thinking about Ilmala without having a look at what a rental there might cost, I suggest you look at the cost first.\n\nPeople who describe Pasila as unattractive are generally talking about the East-German-style concrete blocks in Itä-Pasila across the railway line; Länsi-Pasila is nicer, and Ilmala, which could be considered a separate area north of Länsi-Pasila, IMO falls somewhere between the two. It does have good transport connections and, as you say, it's next to Keskuspuisto.",

In this manner, the Finnish lion represented as a jewel in earrings rings, and necklesses that has been worn proudly specially by the far-right militants. Thus, it is common that the Finnish lion with its military narratives appears shining on the streets of Helsinki and other cities of Finland. Even when the Finnish lion is an official national symbol, and its deviated use is illegal, the far-right militants appropriated it. This act that has been considered shameful by the Finnish society in general.\n\n>In recent times, the Finnish lion’s fiercely and combative meanings, have been reclaimed also by Finnish nationals, and immigrants who summoned the lion’s symbolic powers but against the far-right propaganda. One of the strongest public voices who supports this interpretation of the lion has been the pop-singer Alma, who in 2011 at the Official party of the National Finnish Independence Day wore a neckless with the Finnish lion in similar fashion that the Neo-Nazi militants, but as an act of redemption of the national symbol. In an interview, she accompanied her provocative fashion’s gesture against the far-right groups by exalting the historic and symbolic value of the Finnish lion, but also her idea of a multicultural but still united country.\n\n[https://blogs.helsinki.fi/chstudies/2021/02/21/the-finnish-lion/](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/chstudies/2021/02/21/the-finnish-lion/)",

My family though, are basically the opposite - not fans of too much walking, fully equipped accomodation.\n\nRovaniemi looks and sounds beautiful. Helsinki seems to be a whole package - the beautiful church architecture, history, etc.\n\nIs there anywhere you lovely Fins suggest to visit that has a bit of everything? Saunas, cold lakes, history, beautiful buildings, forests with beautiful scenic trails.\n\nI truly appreciate any input,\n\nKiitos 🥰\n\nEdit: I have taken everybody’s suggestions and opinions on board and will be visiting Helsinki and Turku, thank you all ✌🏼",

For example the Turku area (which, as someone from Helsinki, pains me to say). The city is nice, and so is the nature surrounding it. Maybe go on a day cruise in the archipelago, which is quite unique to Finland. (You can do that in Helsinki too, btw). \n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to visit lakes, I would go to the areas around lake Saimaa. Beautiful nature (mosquitoes also like the forests around lakes, but there are less of them than in Lapland). Maybe also see the city Savonlinna.",

And as you go north (where Rovaniemi is), you approach the Arctic circle, above which there are going to be 24 hours of sunlight during the midsummer. So, in addition to the usual trouble with aurora in winter (unpredictable solar activity, and clouds), it will be too bright to see most of anything.  \n\nIn the summer, there is less to do in Rovaniemi because all the Christmas and winter wonderland stuff is off due to lack of snow.  \n\nI think you are more likely to find snow in Australia at that time, since it is winter in the southern hemisphere then and you have some mountains.",

This one was just won by the government with aid from Germany.\n\nIt was extremely cruel and that's why Mannerheim's (head of white guard) actions were questionable. He practically allowed field court permits for low level military officers, what resulted of field executions of captured red guard members. This continued even after surrender, when death sentences were still given for months. Then the politicians realized it went too far and ordered lower sentences. Mannerheim hated  communists. He served most of his life under Czar, so collapse of the empire was a shock. \n\nBoth sides were guilty of terror, but where white guard was systematic, red guard were more random and impulsive.\n\nMy grandfather was just barely 18, when he joined red guard. There was no record of him carrying a weapon and it was typical for younger men to be in supporting role. He ended up in prison camp, but court was delayed just beyond when sentences were lowered. He got sentence from treason, but was released.",

Yes, we have karjalanpaisti, poronkäristys, karjalanpiirakat, and mustamakkara, in addition to those horrible saarioinen \"laatikot\" that are basically remnants of soviet-era proletarian food. There are a few famous pastries as well. This is not a huge list of specialties by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nBasically, the best thing that ever happened to Finnish food was Silvio Berlusconi. He insulted the food here so badly (rightfully so) on multiple occasions that it made us up our game for real. Starting in about 2008, the emergence of central- and southern-european foods began to emerge in Finnish supermarkets. The general unwillingness of the Finnish supermarkets to go \"all in\" or \"full gas\" in 2008 was consequently responsible for the meteoric rise of LIDL Finland, which had up to that point been facing slow adoption in Finland for 7 years or so.\n\nSadly, since about 2-3 years ago, LIDL Finland has stopped most of the central- and southern-european imports and reverted back to the same boring pre-2008 shit food that Berlusconi despised so much. I'm not entirely sure if this was a result of COVID or if the LIDL Finland leadership team just homogenised and decided that people here don't want the same foods as LIDL sells in places with real food cultures.",

However within a couple of months, I started getting salary delays, and the delays turned into unpaid salaries. The employer makes promises but isn't able to fulfill them. Most probably he hasn't got the funds to pay the employees. Keeping it short, what are my options here as my financial situation isn't too good? How can I deal with the problem? I'm new here and unfamiliar with labor laws. Also, I'm not a part of any union or anything. For now, I have stopped working but haven't resigned officially.",

To the money that is underpaid you most likely will have to say goodbye. If there is no money, there is no money. No lawyer or union will magically find it somewhere from under the carpet if your startup's bank account is empty. Your employer knows that if he goes bankrupt, he won't be liable for anything. Run from there, and run fast.",

            "selftext": "What's the most realistic path for a poor EU / US citizen with learning disabilities to study information technology in English at a university of applied sciences? I came across educations.com and there were several English taught IT bachelor's programs. My three biggest concerns, at least with the information that I have would be getting accepted, getting accommodations for my disabilities, and finding housing. My plan was originally to go to community college in Pennsylvania in the USA and then attend a local four-year university to get my degree in IT. The thing is I have government provided healthcare (Medicaid), which I need to keep my retinopathy of prematurity from causing me to go permanently blind, which the next administration plans to cut funding for. I really cannot emphasize how terrible my grades in high school were. Granted, to be fair I didn't try at all and wasn't yet on ADHD medication. I have suffered multiple brain injuries, have retinopathy of prematurity as I said, autism, and ADHD along with various mental health issues. I am also transgender and worry about the next administration taking away my hormones. I don't want to be running away from something all the time, I want to be running towards something. Also, are there any low cost English taught foundation years that allow for admission to a UAS? From the research I've done it seems that if I did attend community college it may allow me to get accepted to a UAS, but few if any of my credits would transfer, since it seems the concept of transferring credits is just not a thing in the EU. Please feel free to correct any misunderstandings but I may have. I thought these programs looked particularly interesting. I've been digging into this sub looking into answers about  IT programs offered by the UAS, and looking at the study in Finland website, but I still feel confused. https://www.utu.fi/en/study-at-utu/bachelors-degree-programme-in-information-and-communication-technology https://www.uef.fi/en/degree-programme/bachelors-degree-programme-in-information-technology https://www.educations.com/information-technology/europe?page=1",

First thing you must know that Finnish higher education is a meritocracy system. Both domestic and international students are ranked by their academic success (grades or commensurate exams) so far. You get in only by beating the bar. Roughly it is a first pass the post -system, i.e. if they have annual intake of 100, the 100 with the best scores get in. \n\nSecond thing is that you have to have enough bank balance for first year (9600€) to aquire a residence permit for studies.\n\nLucky for you UAS are not generally appriciated, which means that provincial UASes have pretty low bars to beat.\n\nI see possible options to be:\n\nPay the tuition yourself -> can't do because poor.\n\nBeat the system with academic success and get success -> can't because bad past academic success.\n\nLearn Finnish to enroll Finnish speaking course -> takes time, and I'd say not realistic given the academic success so far.\n\nIf you want to see how the student life in Finland is, best bet is a student exchange program.",

Looks like they are using Helsinki airport pretty actively. Even some products in the supermarkets are trying to appeal to russians... I can see Siperia center in Tampere written in their national flag colors. It's quite triggering and so visible for me. \nI am not here to tell you what to not/do, but it's also not strange for me now to hear this. As it looks like Finland actually wants for things to settle and do some real business with russia.\n\n\nOff topic I think they were blessed to have such neighbors like Finland.

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI need some guidance regarding union benefits and recent rule changes. I’m working in Finland and signed up for union benefits. Here's the situation:\n\nBefore September 2024, the rule was that employees are eligible for union benefits after 6 months of continuous employment. However, from September 2024 onwards, this will change to requiring 1 year of continuous employment to qualify.\n\nI started my job in May 2024, and my current contract runs until December 2024, meaning I’ll have been employed for 8 months by then. When I joined, the 6-month rule was still in place.\n\nSo, my question is:\n\n* Will I qualify for union benefits under the old 6-month rule, since I joined while that was in effect?\n\n* Or will I fall under the new 1-year rule, even though I signed under the previous terms?\n\n\nShould I reach out to my union to clarify this? I don’t want to miss out on benefits if I’m eligible!\n\nAppreciate any advice or insight from those familiar with Finnish labor unions and these kinds of transitions. Thanks in advance!\n",

Many people are depressed, feeling their lives have no purpose, unable to find a job or spouse, having financial difficulties etc. The exact meters used in the study have already been mentioned. This is a democratic welfare nation and many basics in life are pretty much cared for by the system. It could be a whole lot worse. \n\nThe society itself is running pretty smoothly, so people have more time to focus on themselves. If they are not doing well, the blame is laid on themselves, because everybody has access to education etc. so any lack of success must be a personal failure. This is a common attitude. In reality, the impact of family background has been growing steadily during the last couple decades, meaning that educated parent with good income have been able to support their children to excell in school and make the right choices to navigate the system for optimal results, while children especially from poorer families or uninvolved parents lack the financial support, connections, and understanding, so they must learn everything by trial and error. Finland has a harsh winter and no family could survive living in the streets. A warm home is part of a minimal living requirements that are provided by the social support and one must be a substant abuser in order to lose that.\n\nPeople always and everywhere tend to take things they are born and raised with for granted. Everybody’s childhood experiences are what constitutes normal for them. The is no global shared experience of what is normal or average. So, even if Finland appears to be ’happy’ by global standards regarding how the society itself is doing on paper, people can feel miserable because of their personal circumstances. If normal Finns on the streets were asked if they are happy, I bet most would answer something like ’I feel content’ or any variation of that. ’Happiness’ as a word itself, feels like something you need a specific reason to use, never heard people use that to describe their lives on a general level.",

They show in the study that a major part of the variation in the average scores is \"explained\" (in statistical sense) by those factors.

Is there an electonic record where I can check the incoming inspection. Maybe traficom 🤔 \n- I was thinking to get my oil with filter change. Maybe I should get this done with regular maintenance ?\n- Should regular maintenance be done at a Mazda dealership or it can be done at any certified car repairs and they can update online data ?\n- Does it matter if I get katsastus done without changing oil and filter. \n- Extra Question: I am thinking to get katsastus done from Helppokatsastus.

If you can get to Haparanda gp to Gotenbiten they have the best flavour selection and prices are normal. Its next to the Icamax. Snusking is across the highway next to candyworld, slightly cheaper and still good flavour selection. All the other places just seem to have the generic brands. I personally like gotenbiten because they are always changing out stock and you can buy single cans to try out or full logs. Just make sure you only get the legal amount. Tulli is super active about that.",

The smell didn't go away even after turning them on in a ventilated room for a week. \n\nCould someone please recommend a good electric heater that doesn't smell like plastic? I live in a studio apartment with central heating, unfortunately I can't increase the heat. That is why I want to buy a heater. \n\nThank you in advance. ",

You complete the service inbetween high school and university, so usually people are 20-21 years old. \n\nReservist who live abroad won't be called in for refresher training during peace time. That would be mental as foreign employers would have no obligation to let you go. The Defence Forces also have to pay for travel expenses so they opt to not call in people from abroad for refreshers, unless the reservists in question is someone with super niche know-how.",

There's an \"artic resort\" we've been really interested in that advertises sleeping under the northern lights, dogsleds, etc. We have young kids (5 and 9) and will be spinning this as \"we're visiting Santa at the North Pole\" since this place has a super legit Santa's village. \n\nWhat we should be considering for appropriate clothing? We are a skiing family, but the cold we're used to is much less than \"artic cold\", so I want to start preparing early... What kind of clothes would be appropriate for Northern Finland in the winter?  We'll be at a resort indoors, but there's plenty of outdoor activities that we want to be comfortable for too. \n\nAnd anything else we should know about visiting this part of the country?  We've been to Europe but never Finland, so I don't know what I don't know... We're from the Eastern US, if that matters. \n\nThanks!!!",

In Finland we can still say our social care takes rather good care of the needy, which is then shown on the metrics here as they're also satisfied; at least more satisfied than in many other countries where the poor people are in worse situation.\n\nAs mentioned by others, the opinion of the people is likely to change as people are dissatisfied with how everything's gone up in prices and even if they would be ok monetarily still, the dissatisfaction of prices increasing is likely way higher than the actual price hike.",

Sweden has been a kingdom for a long time, so they have their old money traditions and a well established class divide. Whereas Finland was kind of rural and poor peasant piece of land for a long time under both Swedish and Russian rule, so when Finland got independent, there were a lot of socialist democratic principles that semi organically followed from having a young country of mainly working class people. This has been changing in the past decades though, and we can already see the effects of widening class divide and the inequality.\nBut I think one factor is the effect of protestant Christian values like protestant work ethic and the whole anti-lavishness thing",

During the 90s depression a lot of homes were foreclosed on.\n\nIt's not like higher education is expensive anywhere in the EU since tuition fees are capped, many countries don't have tuition or they are very low. \n\nI'm not saying things are _bad_, I'm saying they aren't as good as people _think_. Most people have those things in most EU countries. Finns for whatever reason think they have it better than it is. Once you look at statistics you start to see that most others pay less for the same, meaning the quality of life is higher elsewhere and cost of living is lower. The development trend in Finland has been going downwards for years - these figures should be getting better over time, not worse.\n\nHaving low PPP for example doesn't mean people don't have food to eat... It's a relative measure of performance and purchasing power and shows people in Finland are relatively paying way more than others for the same goods. On paper the median income might look good, but shen you look at the cost you start to see that Finland is beginning to align moreso with Baltics and Southern Europe, than the Nordics. This means disposable income is low and this will show in wealth development over the coming decades.\n\nHence according to statistics which measure cost of living, Finland does not have a reasonable cost of living. It has a high cost of living.",

I would look at the raw data below because the map is not an official map made by the EU nor is it accurate, and it excludes certain Eastern EU states. From the raw data you can see that the trend is increasing, as in more people are at risk. However, if you look at the raw data you can see that very large parts of the EU are only counted for 21-23, instead of from 2014. That skews the averages a lot. Keep in mind that year span overlaps with covid hence taking figures to form a 10 year average with only those years counted for does not pain a very accurate picture (FI has full data).\n\n That specific statistic shows that the very poorest in Finland are in a good position relative to the measuring criteria - it doesn't show though how many points on average people were unable to have access to per country and which ones. \n\nIt's good to remember that data like this is heavily skewed by the after effects of covid which went down very differently in various countries. Nonetheless this data doesn't in anyway change the points I raised relating to whether Finland has a reasonable cost of living, which it doesn't.\n https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=INFORMA_test&oldid=650659\n\nAlso cost of living =//= poverty measures.

But we are very unequal, and don't have an especially strong social safety net. Moderately poor Americans actually are doing pretty well compared to a lot of the world, but it doesn't *feel* that way. It's very easy to find people who seem much better off than you (though often they are in a lot of debt!), and lots of people lack financial security.\n\nOne thing I learned, which really stayed with me, is that more unequal societies purchase more luxury goods--regardless of people's income. Luxury goods are typically a waste of money in my opinion, but when inequality is on full display, lots of people feel the need to act like they have more than they do. And that just makes rhe whole problem worse.",

I've witnessed many buying thick padded shoes that seem to appeal those with little experience on being in cold. Those shoes are usable only for a while until being saturated by the humidity from the foot or by melting snow. \n\nMuch better alternative is to acquire thin shelled boots and a variety of socks that provide the insulation and moisture removal. The thicker outer layer wool socks are easy to replace and set drying while continuing doing outside activities. Also you'd be able to use the same boots in varying weathers and it would be wasteful to have several pairs of shoes to meet every possible temperature/wetness combination experienced. This would be emphasized if you are spending only a short period in our harsh climate.\n\nThere a plenty of different mil surplus stores that provide Norwegian M77 or Swiss M90 combat boots, both of witch a good choice. You simply need to find the correct size that allows enough of padding to be used.",
