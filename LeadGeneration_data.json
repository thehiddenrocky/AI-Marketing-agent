            "selftext": "If you’ve ever watched users bounce from your lead forms, you know how frustrating it can be. But here’s a pro tip that’s been a game-changer for us: **Break your form into multiple steps**.\n\nHere’s why it works:\n\n1.  **Start with the Essentials:** Lead with the basics—name, email, phone number. Get those first few fields out of the way, and make sure they don’t feel overwhelmed by a huge wall of text. Once you’ve got the basics, you can slowly ask for more details on subsequent steps.\n    \n2.  **Use a Progress Indicator:** Nothing kills motivation like an _unknown_—that’s why adding a **progress bar or step indicator** can boost completion rates like crazy. When users can see how much longer they’ve got, they’re more likely to finish the form.\n    \n\nI’ve seen this approach work wonders, and I’d love to hear if it’s made a difference for you too! 💡 What steps or hacks do you use to keep people engaged in your forms?",

Contacts, leads, prospects.\n\n7. Decide if you want to work by yourself or with a partner or with a business coach.\n\nThat's a brief overview and the devil remains in the details.\n\nIn regard to the tools that depends on your strategy and target market.

            "selftext": "Hello, so, I am relatively new to this. But I do manage social media for one client. I have recently joined her team. \n\nThis client is a damn good Astrologer and Psychic. Terrifically good. Like literally uses no tools, mind reader. \n\nAnd I am thinking there's lot of potential and money to be made from generating leads for her.  \n\nBecause with astrology and all, there's always a returning client based. And people immediately pay to book an appointment. \n\nTo entice the audience, we did run a lot of ads on Facebook with free Reading and session offers.\n\n We got atleast 1000+ wanting the free reads and about 20% conversion, but it was an absolutely exhausting experience for her to read for so many people. She only charges 10$ for a reading for 30 mins. So we just made about 2000$. Ofcourse, we are hoping most clients will return. However, was this worth the effort?\n\nShe was really famished at the end of it. It was too much for too little. She must have spent 1000 hours in those free readings. \n\nI am not an lead generation expert. So, I am looking for an expert to help me get leads for her on commission basis or per sale basis + plus anyone who could give us guidance with pricing and running free offers. ",

            "selftext": "If you’re not paying attention to the **little things** in your mobile lead forms, you could be missing out on a ton of conversions. Two easy-to-implement tricks that can make a HUGE difference:\n\n1. **Use the Right Input Types:** Sounds basic, but it’s super effective! Make sure you’re using input types like `email` for email fields and `tel` for phone numbers. Why? Because it **auto-triggers the right keyboard** on mobile devices, making it way easier for users to enter their info without any hassle. Less frustration = more lead-form completions.\n2. **Enable Autofill:** Let your users **autofill** their details whenever possible! Autofill can save people tons of time, and the less they have to type, the more likely they are to complete your form.\n\nWhat other small tweaks have you made to your mobile forms that resulted in higher lead-form completions?",

Additionally, using clear and concise language in form labels and buttons can make the process more user friendly.",

I used to rely on a single lead provider, and it worked great at first. However, one of my clients recently requested both high-volume and high-quality marketing.\n\nOver the past two months, I’ve been using a combination of lead providers:\n\n* **Warpleads** for unlimited/bulk lead exports (for volume)\n* **Prospeo** with **Sales Navigator** for more targeted, quality leads\n\nSo far, I’ve been able to close 64 sales for them in the last two months, which has been a great result.\n\nI’m curious, does anyone else use a mix of lead providers? If so, what’s your approach, and has it been effective for you?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

This might look like: \n\n- Day 1: Email \n- Day 2: Cold call \n- Day 3: LinkedIn Message\n- Day 4: Call \n- Day 5: Email \n\nEtc etc for a max of 15 business days (with some days of 0 outreach). \n\nSo in principle, Paid Ads and LeadGen/Outbound is very very similar and the skills you’ve got will definitely cross over! ",

            "selftext": "Last year, I started a SaaS business in Toronto. I won’t dive into the details to avoid sounding like an ad, but our focus was helping companies integrate multiple AI platforms seamlessly. Think of it as a hub model—subscription-based, pay online, and start using.\n\nFor most of the year, we were a five-person team: four co-founders and one employee. At our peak, we had 10 people. During development and launch, we faced every challenge. There were technical issues, design debates, and team disagreements. We struggled to fund the project. There was even a debate over working remotely or renting an office. That’s when I realized just how tough sales could be.\n\nOur struggles were pretty universal for startups, and honestly, most fail to solve this problem. Maybe 80-90% of companies don’t crack it. We were lucky—we found a way to keep the business alive. More than that, we made it a place where our small team had better lives than at a 9-to-5: freedom, income, and yes, a sense of purpose.\n\nWhen we were about to launch our product, we hired a sales expert. Of course, they left after a while—no hard feelings, startups are chaos. We tried hiring more salespeople, buying leads, sending emails, making calls, and doing endless meetings. Revenue grew, but so did costs. We bought more leads, hired more salespeople, and everyone got burnt out. The leads were hit-or-miss—some required endless follow-ups, while others could convert quickly. It was exhausting.\n\nAt one point, we realized this wasn’t sustainable. Everyone was overworked and unhappy. We paused, reviewed our problems, and went back to basics. Could we automate more? Simplify things? Let sales focus only on converting warm leads rather than chasing every single one? Could we stop wasting money on random leads and focus on quality?\n\nThat’s when we decided to bring in AI. We cut part of our sales budget and started using AI Sales Rep. Yes, even as an AI company, we needed to buy AI tools ourselves. We divided our approach:\n\n* For long-term growth, we let AI handle potential clients on social platforms like LinkedIn. It’s cost-effective for building trust and relationships.\n* For short-term stability, our sales team focused on a few high-quality lead sources, ensuring we didn’t lose money.\n\nAI Sales Rep took over each salesperson’s LinkedIn account. We fed it product prices, company info, and other key details. The AI would reach out, engage, answer questions, and build trust—entirely on its own. Only after the AI generated a lead with contact details would our sales team step in, schedule a meeting, and close the deal.\n\nThis shift transformed everything. Salespeople could focus on strategy and conversions, not endless follow-ups. Within a cycle, everyone felt calmer and more productive. We decided to keep things lean instead of scaling up the team.\n\nNow, with over 30 LinkedIn accounts managed by AI, it feels like we have a 30-person salesforce, even though we’re still a 10-person company. The AI handles multilingual outreach to places like Japan and Saudi Arabia, markets where we wouldn’t otherwise compete. For a small company like ours, breaking into those markets with 24/7 operations was a game-changer.\n\nOn LinkedIn, we’ve built communities and content while upgrading our product. Customers stay engaged, and it’s a virtuous cycle. Our costs have only slightly increased, but revenue keeps growing. Everyone on the team is happier, more stable, and thinking more strategically.\n\nI’m sharing this because I believe every entrepreneur should reflect on their **\"why\"**. Great companies don’t start with everything going smoothly. Taking a different path often leads to unique outcomes. If you feel stuck, try a new approach—chasing the same strategies as everyone else will only wear you out.\n\n",

Get a set of leads (e.g. via apollo)\n\n2. Then for each lead:\n\n2.1. Get some useful insights about the lead from 3d party service (e.g. professional insights or personal interests)\n\n2.2. Let GPT update the email template using this data, to make much more personalized message (using these insights about the user)\n\n2.3. Send the message :)\n\n  \nCould you advise any proper tools to:\n\n\\- get this relevant 3d party user data to personalize the message\n\n\\- cold emailing software, where I can add AI prompts to the email templates (actually to dynamically embed this extra information for a warmer outreach)\n\n  \nI've heard about Clay or Smartlead, but not sure they are exactly what I need.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I am sending test emails to my gmail and other outlook accounts, and I continue to get the error message 'Remote server returned '550 5.7.708 Service unavailable. Access denied, traffic not accepted from this IP.' To be clear, when I send it from Outlook directly the email goes through to both Outlook and gmail emails. I see smartleads recommended here alot, but this has me worried that I may need to use another tool like salesloft or outreach or something because the tool itself is getting marked as spam.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this and if so how did you get around it? I made the email domain yesterday and just put it into smartleads today if that helps. Not sure if it is a warm up issue, since the emails send from the ESP directly but not from smartleads.",

Following others means you’re always playing catch-up, especially in a fast-paced, competitive area like lead generation. I’d suggest starting with AI — develop your unique skills and knowledge instead of trying to master what others are already pros at.\n\nCheck out this video [https://youtu.be/l-YBhSImsDs?si=u2RAxl\\_ngoG55kUu](https://youtu.be/l-YBhSImsDs?si=u2RAxl_ngoG55kUu) .

            "selftext": "Hello! Just wanted to share my learnings since I started out my AI Automation Agency particularly building my own custom lead generation application. So... one of the things I realized when working with thousands of leads and automating workflows, small details can make a huge difference.\n\nI know many of us here are using one or two lead generation strategies. Just wanted to share TWO key takeaways from my recent projects that might help you streamline your processes (and avoid the mistakes I made..and hours wasted 😭):\n\n1. Web Scraping Doesn’t Always Guarantee Quality Leads\n\nIf you’ve ever scraped business data from platforms like Google Maps, you’ve probably noticed that not all websites are live or accurate. Many businesses haven’t updated their profiles, resulting in 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Server Error) pages.\n\nWhat I did:\n\n✅ To filter out bad URLs, I created a simple Google Sheets App Script that checks the HTTP status codes of websites.\n\nHere’s the script I used:\n\n*function getStatusCode(url){*\n\n*var options = {*\n\n*'muteHttpExceptions': true,*\n\n*'followRedirects': false*\n\n*};*\n\n*var url\\_trimmed = url.trim();*\n\n*var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url\\_trimmed, options);*\n\n*return response.getResponseCode();*\n\n*}*\n\nBy using the formula =getSTATUSCODE(), you can classify URLs based on their status codes:\n\nGood URLs: 200 (OK), 202 (Accepted), 300-399 (Redirects)\n\nBad URLs: 404 (Not Found), 500-505 (Server Errors), etc.\n\nThis step ensures your database is clean and ready for meaningful outreach.\n\n2. Validate Emails Before Sending Automated Campaigns\n\nWhen running automated email campaigns, invalid email addresses can cause errors and lower your delivery rates. For example, during a recent free AI webinar sign-up I conducted here in the Philippines, I noticed typos like .con instead of .com slipping through the system.\n\nWhat I did:\n\n✅ Use simple validation formulas like =isemail() in Google Sheets to catch invalid email formats before sending. Tools like this help ensure your automation runs smoothly and emails reach the right inbox.\n\nI am sure you guys understand that data quality is everything when scaling automated workflows. My thinking is by proactively validating websites and emails, we will not only save time but also improve the success rate of our campaigns. Automation is powerful, but clean data is what makes it truly effective.\n\nWhat challenges have you faced when working with large datasets or running automated campaigns?\n\nLet’s learn from each other—drop your thoughts below!",

I know it’ll involve creating landing pages, maybe running ads, and optimizing online presence. I’m still trying to figure out the most effective approach, especially if I want the leads to come straight to us and be exclusive.\n\nFor those who’ve built out lead-gen systems or are familiar with this process, what tips or tools would you recommend?

Run ads to drive traffic to these pages. ConvertFlow is good for building and A/B testing landing pages with personalized funnels.\n\nYou can use WordPress (using Elementor or Divi) and Wix to create decent mobile-friendly websites. These two are super easy to use because there are templates if you use Elementor, for example, and everything is just drag and drop. Think Canva, except it's for creating websites. You don't even need to learn how to code.\n\nAfter setting up, add lead capture forms with HubSpot or Google Forms on high-traffic pages. This is a straightforward way to collect leads. You can boost visibility by optimizing for search engines and regularly posting valuable content.\n\nEncourage clients to review your business on Google My Business, Facebook, Yelp or check for relevant leads on Thumbtack or Nextdoor for additional local exposure. You can also use tools like Hootsuite or Sprout Social to monitor keywords and mentions, so you can jump into relevant conversations on Twitter, LinkedIn/Facebook groups, or Reddit. \n\nFor budget, $500–$1,000 a month on Google or Facebook ads is a decent start. With a CPL of $15–$50, a $1,000 budget at a $25 CPL could get you around 40 leads. With good landing pages, you might see a 5–10% conversion rate, so out of 1,000 visitors, you could expect 50–100 opt-ins. Over time, tweaking your targeting, ad creatives, and page content can bring down your CPL and improve conversions.\n\nP.S. We provide lead generation services. If you need any help with this, don't hesitate to DM us.",

The test was quite extensive, but I managed to pass it!\n\nYou might wonder why I pursued this certification. Well, one of my cousins, who works in Google Ads support, suggested it as a way to attract high-quality clients. Many clients consider this certification an indicator of trust and professionalism, which can really help in building credibility.\n\nNow, I understand that having the certification doesn’t necessarily make you an expert at running successful campaigns—it all comes down to skill, strategy, and analytics. But from a client’s perspective, it adds value by showing commitment to understanding best practices.\n\nWhat do you all think? Is it worth having a Google Ads certification?",

If you’re in debt, lending, collections or lead generation, this tool could streamline your process. Here’s how it works:\n\nOur API can deliver unsecured debt loads, tradeline data, FICO bands, mortgage details, collection data, charge-offs, and virtually any other credit parameter you need.\n\nAs long as you have consumer info, we can match the inbound caller’s phone number to their record, delivering verified credit information instantly. You choose the parameters, and we provide real-time data for more effective call routing. (In other words you can route your inbound calls to a dedicated number and we will deliver the call to the relevant queue based on parameters in real time)\n\nNot only does this tool streamline inbound call handling, but it’s also adaptable for bulk data and can overlay onto internal lead generation efforts to enhance qualification and routing.\n\nWhether you’re looking to increase conversion rates, improve internal lead generation or make inbound workflows more efficient, this software offers targeted, real-time insights on each lead. DM me for more details if you’re interested!",

It’s a necessary tool but shouldn’t be relied on too heavily. Instead, I've tested using AI on LinkedIn to automatically connect with potential clients, personalize communication with product information, and guide them to either make a purchase or leave their phone number for follow-up. The advantage here is the establishment of trust. Like with email, once I provide the product info, the AI handles everything else. So far, the response rate is 20.45% and the conversion rate is 29.09%. These are real numbers—I’ve tracked about 300 contacts over two weeks using Excel.",

This is quite new to me but any advice would be helpful.\n\n'Good morning/afternoon/evening (Name),\n\nI will be brief. We are a business advisory practice which functions based upon a primarily loss leading model, which means if we don't provide value, we lose money. \n\nWe are currently looking for new businesses to help grow, optimise and achieve their goals through our data driven process optimisation approach. We take the time to understand the causes of the blockages that are holding your business back and the changes required to address them. \n\nHere are some examples of previous businesses we have partnered with, (news article about business we grew and lead through to significant exit), (accounts of long term client we are allowed to use in marketing) and link to some references. \n\nWe offer a free audit of your accounts in order for us to have a more detailed understanding of your business and provide our insights free of charge. \n\n  \nAll the best,\n\n(Helios\\_\\_Selene)'",

If you use it alone, you won't be able to fully utilize the allowances Sales Navigator provides.

I add Sales Navigator to each AI account, allowing the AI to continuously add friends, communicate, introduce products, and generate leads for me 24/7. This way, it pays off, especially when you're managing dozens of LinkedIn accounts with AI.",

All of the strategies are welcome but you have to be able to analyze them cost/time consuming/efficiency way..

In that sense, I am starting high up on the decision maker chain and working my way down until I get a hit. Learning about ICP and messaging as I go.\n\nWe will basically need at least 2 seats for any software we use, or otherwise divide and conquer 1 seat for multiple platforms and share somehow (ie one of us uses Apollo, one uses Sales Nav.) Budget is $500/mo until I can prove results and request more for specific channels\n\n\n\nI need to trial/error with a combination of inbound and outbound with the intent of getting 1-2 booked calls a week as we learn more about how to frame to these stakeholders and refine.\n\n\n\nOutbound, I've been experimenting heavily with trials on:  \n\\-Apollo\n\n\\-Sales Navigator\n\n  \nThese seem comprehensive but also I can see how they will eat a big portion of the budget. I also have seen posts saying you can use Sales nav to do the heavy lifting for contact info and bits and pieces of other platforms for outreach (zoominfo or something)\n\n  \nI've been distracted by:  \n\\-Mailshake\n\n\\-Instantly.AI\n\n\\-Snov.io\n\nThey seem helpful but not as comprehensive as the above, so I feel like I'll be saving money but hitting some walls and not getting all the data I need to make a decision on what is or isnt working.\n\n\n\nI also want to slowly build up our inbound channels, so I am keeping an eye on SEM, SEO efforts and some inbound automation tools like [Kit.com](http://Kit.com) . \n\n  \nApologies if I haven't provided enough information or if this is something that gets posted frequently! As mentioned, I've gone down numerous rabbit holes, demo calls, and of course sifted through dozens of self promotions in each thread.\n\n",

            "selftext": "In digital marketing, it’s tempting to go for quick fixes—like buying cheap traffic or using generic SEO. While these tactics may bring short-term results, they rarely build sustainable growth. Here’s why they hurt your brand and what to do instead.\n\n# 1. Cheap Traffic Won’t Convert\n\nBuying traffic or using clickbait might bring visitors, but they rarely turn into paying customers. Focus on attracting *qualified* leads who genuinely care about your offer.\n\n# 2. SEO Shortcuts Aren’t Sustainable\n\nKeyword stuffing and black-hat tactics might get you rankings temporarily, but they’ll hurt your site long-term. Real SEO requires high-quality content, optimization, and relevant backlinks.\n\n# 3. Over-Promoting on Social Media Turns Off Audiences\n\nSocial media should build relationships, not just promote products. Share valuable content, engage with your audience, and offer insights that build loyalty.\n\n# 4. Google Ads Without Strategy Waste Money\n\nGoogle Ads can burn through your budget if you don’t have a clear strategy. Focus on precise targeting and continuous optimization to get the best ROI.\n\n# 5. Consistency is Key\n\nQuick fixes lead to inconsistent messaging, confusing your audience. Stay consistent with your brand message and focus on solving your customers’ problems.\n\n# What Should You Do Instead?\n\n* **Be Strategic**: Develop a marketing strategy with long-term goals.\n* **Provide Real Value**: Deliver value through your content and service.\n* **Track and Optimize**: Continuously measure and adjust your campaigns.\n\n# Final Thought\n\nQuick fixes may give temporary results, but true success comes from consistent, long-term strategies. Build relationships, offer real value, and focus on long-term growth.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Have quick fixes worked for you, or have you seen their drawbacks? Let me know!",

            "selftext": "We’ve all been there—building lead forms that look great on desktop, only to see them _flop_ on mobile. After trying and testing a bunch of strategies, here are two simple elements that have made a big difference in boosting our form completion rates:\n\n1.  **Large Tappable Buttons:** On mobile, people don’t want to zoom in or squint at tiny buttons. We’ve found that **large, easily tappable buttons** are a game-changer. They make it super easy for users to submit their info without any frustration. Big buttons = more conversions!\n    \n2.  **Whitespace, Whitespace, Whitespace:** A cluttered form is a turn-off. Giving enough **space around each element** doesn’t just make your form look cleaner—it makes it _easier_ for people to fill it out without accidentally tapping the wrong thing.\n    \n\nThese two simple changes have really helped us increase conversions. \n\nWhat are the little things you implement in your lead forms to get those _high_ completion rates?",

Mass emailing is my last resort because it has a low chance of engagement due to the lack of trust, so I use it with low expectations. I've tested using AI on LinkedIn to automatically add potential clients and personalize communication with product info, guiding them to purchase or leave their number for me to follow up. The advantage is building trust, and like emails, once I provide the product info, AI handles the rest. Currently, I’m seeing a response rate of 20.45% and a conversion rate of 29.09%. This is real data—I’ve watched my Excel sheet as AI contacted around 300 people in two weeks.",

            "selftext": "Many businesses struggle with lead quality – unresponsive leads, low budgets, or targeting that doesn’t hit the mark. If you’re facing these challenges, this post is for you. Let’s dive into some proven strategies.\n\n1. Testing Issue: Not testing enough.\nSolution: Avoid broad targeting or using only one or two creatives. Test various combinations of audience, creative, and offer to find what works best. Once you identify the winning formula, it’s much easier to scale effectively.\n\n2. Landing Page\nIssue: Basic or unappealing landing pages.\nSolution: You’re competing with many businesses, so make your landing page stand out. Add elements that build trust, such as testimonials, offers (e.g., free consultations), and experience highlights. A compelling landing page and a chatbot can significantly improve lead engagement and conversions.\n\n3. Competitive Research\nIssue: Limited understanding of competitors' tactics.\nSolution: Use the Facebook Ad Library to see how competitors market their products. Study their creatives, offers, and the longevity of their ads. This helps you understand what’s working for others and refine your approach.\n4. Offer Issue: Offers that may backfire.\nSolution: Avoid overly aggressive discounts (like 70-80%) which might signal low demand or poor service quality. Focus on creating offers that convey value without compromising brand perception.\n5. Audience Targeting\nIssue: Relying solely on broad targeting.\n\nSolution: Instead of letting Meta cast a wide net, create multiple, specific audience segments:\nWebsite Visitors\nInstagram Profile Audience\nOffline Lookalikes\nVideo Watchers (60%+ completion)\nPrevious Purchasers\nLookalikes of Existing Customers\nBroad Audience\nMeta AI Targeting\nAction: Test these different audiences to find those that yield the best lead quality.\n\n6. Lead Responsiveness\nIssue: Leads not responding to follow-up.\nSolution: Set up an automated CRM workflow to send an SMS or email as soon as a lead form is filled. Immediate engagement increases the chance of converting leads before they lose interest.\n\n7. Location-Specific Leads\nIssue: Receiving leads outside your target location.\nSolution: Disable “Advanced Targeting” in Meta. With this off, Meta will adhere to the specific locations you select, rather than treating your location settings as suggestions.\n\n8. Conversion Leads Over Lead Generation\nIssue: Low-quality leads from basic lead generation campaigns.\nSolution: Switch to a Conversion Lead Campaign. By linking your CRM to Meta, you can categorize leads (e.g., “interested,” “closed,” etc.), allowing Meta to learn which leads are most valuable and adjust targeting accordingly.\n\n9. Making Too Many Changes Too Quickly\nIssue: Frequent adjustments.\nSolution: Give your ads time to stabilize and perform. Making too many changes in quick succession confuses Meta’s algorithms and hinders optimization.\n\n10. Targeting Higher-Income Customers\nNote: This strategy is especially useful for businesses aiming to reach high-income audiences. Comment below if you’d like to know more, and I’ll share additional insights.\nHope you found this helpful! Apply these tips, and watch your lead quality improve. Have a great day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                    "body": "That's a great question, but I think a better one to ask is, *“Which option works better for you?”* This is because Meta and Google deliver very different types of results, and let me explain.\n\nWith Google, a potential lead actively searches for what they need by typing something like *“homes for sale near me.”* On the other hand, a Meta ad typically appears while someone is scrolling through unrelated content.\n\nMeta often targets users based on their behavior and interests. So, if a user *has* been searching for homes, there's a good chance they’ll see your ad. However, the intent behind these leads differs:\n\n* **Google leads** are typically more intent-driven. They’re actively searching for solutions and are often ready to take action, making them more transactional.\n* **Meta leads** are often more passive. They might not even realize they have a problem to solve until they see your ad, meaning they’re less likely to act immediately.\n\nBoth lead types can be valuable, but what matters most is how you handle them after they enter your funnel.\n\n* **Passive leads** (Meta) are usually cheaper to acquire but require more nurturing. They take longer to convert and often close at a lower rate.\n* **Active leads** (Google) are more expensive upfront but require less nurturing and tend to close faster with a higher success rate.\n\nEach funnel should be designed to meet the lead where they are in their buying or selling journey, focusing on nurturing them effectively based on their intent and readiness to act.\n\nHope this helps!",

I work closely with real estate agents and always aim to bring them qualified, ready-to-go buyers.\n\nWhile my SOI has been a consistent lead source, I'm looking to scale up and explore paid leads specifically tailored to our Rochester market. My goal is to connect with more serious, qualified buyers that I can then refer to my agent partners. Any recommendations for lead services that have worked well in upstate NY or similar markets?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!\n\n",
